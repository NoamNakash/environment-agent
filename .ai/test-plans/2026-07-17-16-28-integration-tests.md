# Integration Test Plan: Environment Agent

## Overview

This document outlines the Integration Test Plan for the DCM Environment Agent, covering all 9 topics and cross-cutting concerns. Integration tests assert **observable behaviors** that require real dependencies — HTTP servers, persistence, messaging systems, and network calls to SPs and DCM.

**BDD scope:** Each test asserts what a consumer (HTTP client, DCM Control Plane, SP, or NATS subscriber) would observe. Pure algorithms (backoff formula, LRU data structure internals, pattern validation) are unit-tested; integration tests only assert the observable outcomes of those mechanisms.

**Caller-Trust:** Preconditions that upper layers already guarantee are not re-tested.

## Test Infrastructure Assumptions

| Dependency | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| HTTP Server | Real HTTP server started on random available port |
| File System | Real filesystem (OS-level temp directory) for persistence tests |
| NATS JetStream | Real server (embedded `nats-server` with JetStream or testcontainer) |
| DCM Control Plane | Mock HTTP server capturing `POST /api/v1/agents` and `PUT /api/v1/agents/{agentId}/heartbeat` |
| External SPs | Mock HTTP servers simulating health responses and create/delete responses |
| Embedded SPs | Real in-process SP stubs with controllable health |
| Clock/timing | Shortened intervals in test config for determinism |

### Shared Fixtures

Unless overridden, tests use:
- `AGENT_NAME=agent-prod-1`
- `AGENT_ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `AGENT_COST=medium`
- `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME=agent-prod-1`
- `DCM_REGISTRATION_URL=<mock DCM base URL>`
- `AGENT_MESSAGING_URL=<test NATS URL>`

## Topic 1: HTTP Server

### IT-HTTP-010: Server starts on configured address

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, OS network stack
- **Given** the agent is configured with `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:0` (random port)
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the HTTP server MUST accept TCP connections on the allocated port
- **And** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` MUST return HTTP 200

---

### IT-HTTP-020: All OpenAPI routes are registered

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the HTTP server has started
- **When** requests are made to each defined endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v1alpha1/health`
  - `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers`
  - `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers`
  - `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers/{provider_id}`
- **Then** each request MUST be routed to the corresponding handler (i.e., MUST NOT return 404)

---

### IT-HTTP-030: Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-030, AC-HTTP-080
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, OS process signaling, slow endpoint
- **Given** the agent is running and a slow in-flight request is active (handler sleeps < shutdown timeout)
- **When** SIGTERM is sent to the process
- **Then** new connection attempts after the signal MUST be refused
- **And** the in-flight request MUST complete normally
- **And** the process MUST exit with code 0
- **And** logs MUST contain a shutdown initiation message

---

### IT-HTTP-040: Graceful shutdown on SIGINT

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** Same as IT-HTTP-030
- **Given** the agent is running with an in-flight request
- **When** SIGINT is sent to the process
- **Then** behavior MUST be identical to SIGTERM (as tested in IT-HTTP-030)

---

### IT-HTTP-050: Shutdown timeout closes in-flight connections

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, `AGENT_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=1s`, raw TCP connection with partial request body
- **Given** the agent is running with shutdown timeout of 1s and an in-flight connection held open (partial HTTP request body)
- **When** SIGTERM is sent
- **Then** the in-flight connection MUST be terminated after the 1s drain timeout (client receives connection reset or EOF)
- **And** the process MUST exit with code 0

---

### IT-HTTP-060: Configuration loaded from environment variables

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090` is set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the server MUST listen on port 9090

---

### IT-HTTP-070: Request logging includes required fields

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, log capture
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` is processed
- **Then** logs MUST contain an INFO-level entry with: method=`GET`, path=`/api/v1alpha1/health`, status=`200`, and a non-zero duration

---

### IT-AUTH-120: Missing-credential rejection produces one request audit log entry

- **Validates AC:** AC-AUTH-110
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server wired with the real `auth.Middleware` (mock `JWTValidator`), log capture
- **Given** the agent is running with authentication enabled
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` is sent without an `Authorization` header
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 401
- **And** exactly one INFO-level request audit log entry MUST be emitted for that request, with method=`GET`, path=`/api/v1alpha1/providers`, status=`401`, and a non-zero duration
- **And** the middleware ordering (auth before `RequestLogger`) MUST remain unchanged

---

### IT-AUTH-121: Invalid-credential rejection produces one request audit log entry

- **Validates AC:** AC-AUTH-110
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server wired with the real `auth.Middleware` (mock `JWTValidator` returning an error), log capture
- **Given** the agent is running with authentication enabled
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` is sent with `Authorization: Bearer invalid-token`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 401
- **And** exactly one INFO-level request audit log entry MUST be emitted for that request

---

### IT-AUTH-122: Successful authenticated request retains JWT identity in the audit log

- **Validates AC:** AC-AUTH-110, AC-AUTH-070
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server wired with the real `auth.Middleware` (mock `JWTValidator` returning claims), log capture
- **Given** the agent is running with authentication enabled
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` is sent with a valid Bearer token whose claims include `sub=user-123` and `preferred_username=jdoe`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200
- **And** exactly one INFO-level request audit log entry MUST be emitted including `sub=user-123` and `preferred_username=jdoe`

---

### IT-AUTH-130: A hanging JWTValidator does not hang the request past the configured timeout

- **Validates AC:** AC-AUTH-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server wired with the real `auth.Middleware`, a `JWTValidator`
  whose `Validate` deliberately outlasts the configured timeout (returns on `ctx.Done()` or its own
  delay, whichever comes first — the same idiom as IT-HTTP-120's slow handler),
  `AGENT_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=1s`
- **Given** the agent is running with authentication enabled and a per-request timeout of 1s
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` is sent with a Bearer token, and the validator would take
  3s to return (an error, in this case)
- **Then** the client MUST receive a response at approximately the 1s timeout, not the validator's
  3s delay
- **And** the response MUST be HTTP 503 with RFC 9457 body (`type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unavailable`) — deterministically,
  never the 401 the validator's error would otherwise have produced, and never a 200 — because
  `RequestTimeout` only checks `ctx.Err()` after `next.ServeHTTP` returns and unconditionally
  discards the buffered response once the deadline has already passed (DD-170)
- **Note:** demonstrates that the middleware ordering from AC-AUTH-090 (auth executing after
  `PanicRecovery` and before `RequestLogger`) also places auth *inside* `RequestTimeout`'s
  boundary, so a hanging validator cannot hang the whole server past the deadline

---

### IT-HTTP-080: Panic recovery returns RFC 9457 INTERNAL error

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-070
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server with a test handler that panics
- **Given** a handler is registered that triggers a panic
- **When** a request is made to that handler
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 500
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/internal`
- **And** the body MUST NOT contain stack traces or file paths
- **And** the process MUST NOT crash
- **And** logs MUST contain an ERROR-level entry with the panic and stack trace

---

### IT-HTTP-081: Panic recovery still produces a request audit log entry

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server with a test handler that panics, log capture
- **Given** a handler is registered that triggers a panic
- **When** a request is made to that handler
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 500 (as tested in IT-HTTP-080)
- **And** logs MUST also contain an INFO-level `msg=request` audit log entry with `status=500`
- **Note:** guards the DD-510 centralization of audit-log emission in `RequestTimeout` against
  regressing the pre-existing guarantee that a panicking request still produces one audit entry
  (previously emitted by `RequestLogger`'s own panic-safe defer, calling `auth.LogRequest`
  directly; now emitted via `RequestTimeout`'s recover, using the status `RequestLogger` recorded
  into the shared `requestctx.Outcome` before the panic reached it)

---

### IT-HTTP-090: Lifecycle logging on startup and shutdown

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-080
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, log capture
- **Given** the agent starts and then is shut down
- **When** startup and shutdown complete
- **Then** logs MUST contain the listen address on startup
- **And** logs MUST contain shutdown initiation and completion messages

---

### IT-HTTP-100: Malformed request returns 400 with RFC 9457

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with an invalid JSON body (`{"bad":`)
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 400
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/invalid-argument`

---

### IT-HTTP-110: Framework-layer error responses are RFC 9457

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-091
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** a request triggers a framework-level parsing failure
- **Then** the error response MUST have `Content-Type: application/problem+json`
- **And** the body MUST conform to RFC 9457

---

### IT-HTTP-110b: Strict handler JSON-decode failure is RFC 9457, not the SDK default

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-091
- **Test Infrastructure:** Strict handler constructed exactly as the composition root
  (`cmd/environment-agent/main.go`), invoked directly (bypassing chi routing and the
  OpenAPI validator middleware) to isolate the `StrictHTTPServerOptions.RequestErrorHandlerFunc`
  wiring choice
- **Given** the strict handler is constructed with `RequestErrorHandlerFunc` set to
  `httperror.WriteInvalidArgument`
- **When** `CreateProvider` receives a body that is syntactically valid JSON but fails
  Go's struct decode (`{"name":123}` — wrong type for a string field)
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 400 with `Content-Type: application/problem+json`
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/invalid-argument`
- **Note:** the oapi-codegen SDK default (unset `RequestErrorHandlerFunc`) instead
  returns `http.Error` — plain text, `text/plain` — for this exact failure. This test
  guards the composition-root wiring choice directly; today's `Provider` request
  schema (all fields are unconstrained strings or readOnly/strictly-formatted, both
  rejected upstream by the OpenAPI validator) does not have a live end-to-end HTTP
  payload that reaches this code path, but any future field addition could make it
  reachable again.

---

### IT-HTTP-120: Per-request timeout enforcement

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-095
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, `AGENT_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=1s`, slow handler (sleeps 3s)
- **Given** the agent is configured with a per-request timeout of 1s
- **When** a request reaches a handler that takes longer than 1s
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 503 with RFC 9457 body (`type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unavailable`)
- **And** the request context MUST be cancelled (handler observes context done)

---

### IT-HTTP-121: Disabled timeout enforcement still buffers, flushes, and audit-logs

- **Validates AC:** AC-HTTP-095
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, `RequestTimeout` configured to `0` (disabled), log capture
- **Given** the agent is configured with per-request timeout enforcement disabled (`timeout <= 0`)
- **When** a request is processed
- **Then** the response MUST still carry the handler's status, headers, and body (buffering and
  flushing MUST still occur)
- **And** exactly one INFO-level `msg=request` audit log entry MUST still be emitted for that
  request
- **Note:** guards `RequestTimeout` always wrapping the request for buffering and single-point
  audit-log emission (DD-510) even when deadline enforcement itself is off — i.e. against the
  previous `if timeout <= 0 { return next }` short-circuit (which skipped buffering and left
  `RequestLogger` to log directly) silently reappearing

---

## Topic 2: Health Service

### IT-HLT-010: Health endpoint returns 200 when healthy

- **Validates AC:** AC-HLT-010, AC-HLT-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server with messaging system connected
- **Given** the HTTP server is running and messaging system is connected
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` is called
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** `Content-Type` MUST be `application/json`

---

### IT-HLT-020: Health response body — healthy state

- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, messaging connected
- **Given** the agent is operational and the messaging system is connected

  - `"status": "healthy"`
  - `"path": "health"`

---

### IT-HLT-030: Health response body — unhealthy state

- **Validates AC:** AC-HLT-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, messaging system disconnected/unavailable
- **Given** the agent is running but the messaging system is disconnected
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` is called
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** the response body MUST contain `"status": "unhealthy"`

---

### IT-HLT-040: Health endpoint performs no blocking I/O

- **Validates AC:** AC-HLT-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, messaging system unreachable (no response possible)
- **Given** the agent is running but external dependencies are unreachable
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` is called 100 times (after 10 warm-up requests)
- **Then** the p99 response time MUST be below 5ms
- **And** the response MUST be derived from in-memory state

---

## Topic 3: SP Registration & Management

### IT-SPR-010: Embedded SP registration at startup

- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=container,cluster`
- **Given** the agent is configured with `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=container,cluster`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` MUST list providers for "container" and "cluster" service types

---

### IT-SPR-020: Embedded SPs not active by default

- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS` not set
- **Given** `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS` is empty or not set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` MUST return an empty `results` array

---

### IT-SPR-030: Embedded SP skipped when slot occupied by persisted external SP

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, persistence with pre-existing external SP, log capture
- **Given** a persisted external SP registration exists for service type "container"
- **And** the agent is configured with `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=container`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` MUST show only the external SP for "container"
- **And** logs MUST contain a WARN-level entry about the skipped embedded SP
- **And** the agent MUST be fully operational (HTTP server listening, health returning 200)

---

### IT-SPR-040: External SP registration — success (new)

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server

  ```json
  {"name": "db-provider", "endpoint": "https://sp.example.com:8080", "service_type": "database", "schema_version": "v1alpha1"}
  ```
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 201 Created
- **And** the response body MUST include server-set fields: `id`, `path`, `create_time`, `update_time`
- **And** `type` MUST be `"external"`

---

### IT-SPR-050: External SP re-registration (idempotent update)

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, pre-registered SP
- **Given** a provider named "db-provider" is already registered for service type "database"
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with the same `name` and `service_type`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** `update_time` MUST be refreshed (later than before)
- **And** `create_time` MUST remain unchanged
- **And** `id` MUST remain unchanged (provider ID is immutable)

---

### IT-SPR-060: Service type conflict

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, embedded SP for "container"
- **Given** an embedded SP is serving service type "container"
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with `{"name": "new-sp", "service_type": "container", ...}`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 409 Conflict
- **And** the error body MUST identify the conflicting provider name and service type

---

### IT-SPR-070: Same SP re-registers for same service type (idempotent, not conflict)

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-070
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** "vm-provider" is registered for service type "vm"
- **When** "vm-provider" re-registers for service type "vm"
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK (not 409)
- **And** `id` MUST remain unchanged (provider ID is immutable)

---

### IT-SPR-080: Persistence across restart

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, real filesystem persistence
- **Given** an external SP "db-provider" is registered for service type "database"
- **When** the agent process is stopped and restarted
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` MUST include "db-provider" with service type "database"
- **And** the registration MUST be loaded before accepting new registrations

---

### IT-SPR-085: Embedded SP preserves identity across restart

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-052
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, real filesystem persistence, `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS`
- **Given** an embedded SP is registered for a persisted service type
- **When** the agent process is stopped and restarted
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` MUST report the same provider `id` and `create_time` for
  that service type as before the restart — the end-to-end companion to `resolveEmbeddedIdentity`'s
  unit tests (UT-SPR-104–107 in `.ai/test-plans/unit-tests.md`), proving identity stability holds
  through the full `LoadPersisted` → `RegisterEmbedded` startup sequence, not just the helper
  function in isolation

---

### IT-SPR-090: Re-registration with changed service type (available)

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-095
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** "db-provider" is registered for service type "database"
- **And** no SP is serving service type "analytics"
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with `{"name": "db-provider", "service_type": "analytics", ...}`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** "db-provider" MUST now serve "analytics"
- **And** the "database" slot MUST be freed (another SP can register for it)

---

### IT-SPR-100: Re-registration with changed service type (conflict)

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-096
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** "db-provider" is registered for "database" and "other-provider" serves "analytics"
- **When** "db-provider" re-registers with `service_type="analytics"`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 409 Conflict
- **And** the error detail MUST name the conflicting holder ("other-provider"), not just the service
  type — this disambiguating case has name != service type, unlike IT-SPR-060's
  embedded-SP case where they coincide
- **And** "db-provider" MUST still serve "database" (no partial state change)

---

### IT-SPR-110: Invalid registration body returns 400

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-100
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with body missing required `service_type`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 400 Bad Request with RFC 9457 error body

---

### IT-SPR-120: Provider ID from query parameter

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-105
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers?id=custom-001` is called with a valid body
- **Then** the response `id` MUST equal `"custom-001"`

---

### IT-SPR-130: Provider ID auto-generated as UUID v4

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-106
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with no `?id=` parameter
- **When** the registration succeeds
- **Then** the response `id` MUST be a non-empty string matching UUID v4 format

---

### IT-SPR-140: Provider ID AEP-122 pattern violation returns 422

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-106b
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers?id=INVALID_ID!` is called
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity`
- **And** the error MUST identify the `?id=` pattern violation

---

### IT-SPR-145: Re-registration with different `?id=` returns 409

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** a provider named "immut-provider" is registered with `?id=original-id`
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers?id=different-id` is called with the same name
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 409 Conflict
- **And** the error body MUST identify both the existing ID and the conflicting requested ID

---

### IT-SPR-146: Re-registration without `?id=` preserves original ID

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** a provider named "preserve-provider" is registered with `?id=my-stable-id`
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with the same name but no `?id=` parameter
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** the response `id` MUST still be `"my-stable-id"` (ID is immutable)

---

### IT-SPR-147: Re-registration with same `?id=` succeeds

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** a provider named "same-id-provider" is registered with `?id=consistent-id`
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers?id=consistent-id` is called with the same name and same ID
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** the response `id` MUST be `"consistent-id"`

---

### IT-SPR-148: Cross-provider ID collision returns 409 naming the existing holder

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-106c
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** provider "collision-holder" is already registered with `?id=shared-id`
- **When** a DIFFERENT, new provider name ("collision-challenger") registers with `?id=shared-id`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 409 Conflict with RFC 9457 body (`type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/already-exists`)
- **And** the error detail MUST name both the requested ID and "collision-holder"
- **Regression for:** this branch of `assignProviderID` (distinct from IT-SPR-145's
  same-name re-registration path) was reachable via a real HTTP request but had zero test coverage;
  code inspection confirmed the behavior was already correct, so this closes a coverage gap rather
  than fixing a bug

---

### IT-SPR-149/149b: Whitespace-padded name/service_type do not bypass idempotency or slot collision

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-071
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **IT-SPR-149 — Given** "ws-provider" is registered, **When** a registration is submitted for
  `name="  ws-provider  "` with the same `service_type`, **Then** the response MUST be 200 OK
  (idempotent update of the same provider) and exactly one provider named (trimmed) "ws-provider"
  MUST exist afterward
- **IT-SPR-149b — Given** a provider holds service type "ws-database", **When** a different
  provider registers with `service_type="  ws-database  "`, **Then** the response MUST be 409
  Conflict (whitespace must not let the collision check be bypassed)
- **Regression for:** `ValidateName`/`ValidateServiceType` rejected purely-empty
  (post-trim) values but never trimmed the value actually used downstream for the
  natural-key/slot lookups, so `"provider1"` and `"provider1 "` registered as distinct providers

---

### IT-SPR-150: Provider schema_version required

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-107
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with body missing `schema_version`
- **When** the request is processed

---

### IT-SPR-160: Semantic validation returns 422

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-108
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with `schema_version="invalid-version"`
- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity`

---

### IT-SPR-165: Endpoint URI semantic validation returns 422

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-108b
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with body `{"name": "bad-sp", "endpoint": "not-a-url", "service_type": "database", "schema_version": "v1alpha1"}`
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **And** the body MUST be RFC 9457 with `type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity`

---

### IT-SPR-170: Persistence load failure causes fail-fast

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-109
- **Test Infrastructure:** Corrupted persistence file
- **Given** the persistence store contains corrupted/unreadable data
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST log the error and exit immediately
- **And** the HTTP server MUST NOT start
- **Note:** this test only exercises `ProviderService.LoadPersisted()` directly via a hand-built
  `startWithPersistence` helper — it does NOT go through `run()`/`main`, so it cannot prove the HTTP
  server never serves. See IT-SPR-171 for the composition-root-level test that does.

### IT-SPR-171: `run()` fails fast on corrupt persisted data without ever serving HTTP

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-109
- **Test Infrastructure:** `cmd/environment-agent`'s `run(ctx)` called directly, with a corrupt
  persistence file and a pre-reserved, known TCP address
- **Given** `AGENT_SP_PERSISTENCE_PATH` points at a file containing invalid JSON
- **When** `run(ctx)` is invoked (the actual composition-root entry point, not a hand-built partial
  wiring)
- **Then** `run` MUST return a non-zero exit code
- **And** an HTTP GET to the exact address `run()` bound internally MUST fail to connect — proving
  `Serve()` was never reached despite `net.Listen` executing before the fail-fast `LoadPersisted`
  check
- **Regression for:** fail-fast behavior was previously verified only at the
  `LoadPersisted()` unit level (IT-SPR-170), never through `run()` itself, so a regression in the
  ordering of checks within `run()` (e.g. an errant early `go srv.Serve(ln)`) would not have been
  caught

---

### IT-SPR-172: `run()`'s composition-root wiring delivers an embedded SP's synchronous initialCheck transition

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-015
- **Test Infrastructure:** `cmd/environment-agent`'s `run(ctx)` called directly (real composition
  root, not hand-built partial wiring), against a real embedded NATS/JetStream test server;
  `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=widget` + `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SP_WIDGET_HEALTH=unhealthy` +
  `AGENT_HEALTH_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=1` force a synchronous Ready->Unhealthy transition during
  `RegisterEmbedded`'s `initialCheck`; a raw NATS subscriber on `dcm.agents.health`
  (`cloudevent.SubjectHealth`) independently observes what `run()` actually publishes
- **Given** `run(ctx)` is invoked with the env above
- **When** the embedded "widget" SP's initial health check synchronously reports Unhealthy during
  `RegisterEmbedded`
- **Then** a `dcm.agent.health.service-type-degraded` CloudEvent for service type "widget" MUST be
  observed on `dcm.agents.health` within a few seconds
- **Regression for:** `UT-SPR-100`/`UT-SPR-101` in
  `internal/provider/service` prove the general ordering property (SetOnTransition must be wired
  before RegisterEmbedded) by manually constructing `ProviderService`/`monitor.Monitor` directly;
  they never touch `main.go`'s `run()` at all, so if `main.go`'s actual wiring order were reverted
  to the pre-fix state, those unit tests would keep passing regardless.

- **And** the REQ-SPR-220 success INFO log MUST NOT be emitted again for that attempt

### IT-SPR-195: Embedded SP removal logged on successful cleanup

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-222

### IT-SPR-199: Health monitor re-registered when only the service type changes

- **Validates AC:** AC-SPR-095
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real health monitor wired to the service; `slog.Handler` capture
- **Given** an external SP is registered for service type "database"
- **When** it re-registers with only `service_type` changed (e.g. to "cache"), leaving `endpoint` unchanged
- **Then** the health monitor's cached registration for that provider MUST be refreshed to the new
  service type — a deeper proof than AC-SPR-095's HTTP-response-only assertion (IT-SPR-090), showing
  the change actually propagates to the health-check wiring, not just the stored record

---

### IT-HMN-150: Pod conditions non-fatal when unavailable

- **Validates AC:** AC-HMN-110
- **Test Infrastructure:** No Kubernetes API available (or returns 403)

- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` MUST return 200 before any DCM registration completes
- **And** the agent process MUST remain running

---

### IT-DCM-030: Registration waits until a non-Unavailable SP exists

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; agent started with no SPs
- **Given** the agent is running with an empty provider set
- **When** a wait window elapses longer than normal registration timing

- **When** the periodic prerequisite-retry ticker (`PrerequisiteRetryInterval`) re-evaluates and the lister now returns a non-empty type list
- **Then** the agent MUST register to DCM, proving the ticker alone (not just an explicit notification) drives re-evaluation

---

### IT-DCM-040: Pre-registration defers service type changes

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-025
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM that delays first success; two external SPs
- **Given** the agent is not yet registered (mock DCM has not returned agentId)
- **When** two SPs register and become Ready before DCM accepts registration

- **Given** a prior run registered successfully with `name="agent-prod-1"` and `agentId="agent-123"`
- **When** the agent restarts and re-registers with the same name
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive another `POST /api/v1/agents`

- **And** heartbeats MUST target `/api/v1/agents/agent-123/heartbeat`

---

### IT-DCM-080: Registration retry with exponential backoff

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning 503 then 201
- **Given** DCM is initially failing and at least one SP is Ready
- **When** registration eventually succeeds
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive multiple attempts before success
- **And** each inter-attempt gap MUST fall within `[0, min(initialInterval × 2^attempt, maxInterval)]` (full jitter range)
- **And** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` MUST remain 200 throughout

---

### IT-DCM-090: Non-retryable error stops retries

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning 400

### IT-DCM-100: 429 respects Retry-After

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-061
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning 429 with `Retry-After: 2` then 201
- **Given** DCM returns 429 with `Retry-After: 2` on first attempt
- **When** the agent retries
- **Then** the second attempt MUST occur no earlier than ~2s after the first response

---

### IT-DCM-105: Standard backoff on 429 without Retry-After

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-061 (second clause)
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning 429 (no Retry-After header) then 201
- **Given** DCM returns 429 without `Retry-After` on first attempt
- **When** the agent retries
- **Then** the gap between attempts MUST be bounded by MaxBackoff + tolerance (standard backoff applied, not infinite wait)
- **And** the gap MUST be greater than 0

---

### IT-DCM-106: Standard backoff on 429 with a past HTTP-date Retry-After

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-061 (second clause)
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM always returning 429 with a `Retry-After` HTTP-date one hour in the past (never succeeds, so retry count over a fixed window directly measures pacing)
- **Given** DCM always returns 429 with a stale/expired `Retry-After` HTTP-date
- **When** the agent retries for a fixed 1s window with InitialBackoff = MaxBackoff = 200ms
- **Then** the registrar MUST still be attempting registration (count > 0)
- **And** the attempt count MUST be well below what a near-zero immediate-retry loop would produce
  (< 40; verified directly against the pre-fix code, which produced 1000+ attempts/sec in the
  same window — an earlier version of this test asserted only `gap > 0` and `gap <= MaxBackoff`
  between the first two attempts, which the pre-fix immediate-retry bug also satisfied by
  accident, since real wall-clock time always elapses even for an "immediate" retry; the fixed
  attempt-count-over-a-window assertion actually discriminates the two behaviors)

### IT-DCM-107: Standard backoff on 429 with a literal "0" Retry-After

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-061 (second clause)
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM always returning 429 with `Retry-After: 0`
- **Given** DCM always returns 429 with a well-formed but non-positive (`"0"`) `Retry-After`
- **When** the agent retries for a fixed 1s window with InitialBackoff = MaxBackoff = 200ms
- **Then** the registrar MUST still be attempting registration (count > 0)
- **And** the attempt count MUST be well below what a near-zero immediate-retry loop would produce
  (< 40) — `ParseRetryAfter("0", ...)` legitimately returns `(0, true)` (distinct from the
  unparseable/past-date/negative cases, which return `(0, false)`), so this exercises
  `computeBackoff`'s own `RetryAfter > 0` guard specifically, not `ParseRetryAfter`'s rejection

---

### IT-DCM-110: Service type change triggers DCM update

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-070
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; agent registered with ["container"]; new SP for "database"
- **Given** the agent is registered with `serviceTypes=["container"]`
- **When** an external SP registers for "database" and becomes non-Unavailable
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive `POST /api/v1/agents` with `serviceTypes` including both

---

### IT-DCM-120: Periodic heartbeat

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-080
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; `AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=1s`
- **Given** registration succeeded with `agentId="agent-123"`
- **When** at least two heartbeat intervals elapse
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive ≥2 `PUT /api/v1/agents/agent-123/heartbeat` calls
- **And** each body MUST include `timestamp` (RFC 3339) and numeric `consumerLag`

---

### IT-DCM-130: Configurable heartbeat interval

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-085
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; `AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=2s`
- **Given** the agent is registered
- **When** heartbeats are observed for ≥6s
- **Then** median interval MUST be approximately 2s (not default 30s)

---

### IT-DCM-135: Heartbeat payload timestamps strictly increase

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-091
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM capturing heartbeat request bodies
- **Given** the registrar sends at least 3 heartbeats over time
- **When** each heartbeat body's `timestamp` field is compared to the previous one
- **Then** each MUST be strictly greater than the previous — unlike IT-DCM-130, which only checks
  the wall-clock gap between requests, this asserts on the `timestamp` value inside the body itself,
  which the control plane rejects if it does not strictly increase

---

### IT-DCM-140: Heartbeat includes consumer lag (main topic only)

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real JetStream; mock DCM; blocked SP
- **Given** the agent's main durable consumer has exactly 5 unacknowledged messages
- **And** retry/cancel topics also have pending messages
- **When** a heartbeat is sent
- **Then** `consumerLag` MUST equal 5 (excludes retry/cancel)

---

### IT-DCM-150: Heartbeat failure resilience

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-095
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning 500 on heartbeats
- **Given** the agent is registered and heartbeat requests fail
- **When** the next heartbeat interval elapses
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive another attempt
- **And** the agent MUST NOT exit
- **And** health endpoint MUST still return 200

---

### IT-DCM-160: All SPs unavailable — empty serviceTypes

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-100
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; two SPs forced to Unavailable
- **Given** the agent is registered with `serviceTypes=["container","database"]`
- **When** both SPs transition to Unavailable
- **Then** mock DCM MUST receive `POST /api/v1/agents` with `serviceTypes=[]`
- **And** heartbeats MUST continue (agent remains registered)

---

### IT-DCM-170: Advertised serviceTypes exclude Unavailable SPs

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-105
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; SPs in Ready, Unhealthy, and Unavailable states
- **Given** SPs for "container" (Ready), "database" (Unhealthy), "storage" (Unavailable)
- **When** the agent sends a registration/update to DCM
- **Then** `serviceTypes` MUST include "container" and "database"
- **And** MUST NOT include "storage"

---

### IT-DCM-175: Re-registration retries through a transient token outage until it succeeds

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-071
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; `flakyTokenSource` fake whose `Token` fails while `failing` is
  set, then succeeds once cleared
- **Given** the agent is registered to DCM
- **When** the configured `TokenSource` starts failing and a single service-type-change
  notification triggers re-registration while it's still failing
- **Then** no new registration request MUST reach DCM while the token source is failing, and the
  previously-assigned agent ID MUST be preserved
- **And** once the token source recovers, the same re-registration attempt (not a new
  notification) MUST eventually reach DCM and succeed, retried via the shared registration backoff
  policy
- **And** the payload of that retried request MUST reflect the updated service types

---

### IT-DCM-176: Per-attempt request timeout bounds a hung re-registration attempt

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-072
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM configured to accept the connection but never respond
  (`hangReg`, reused from IT-DCM-020); `RegistrarConfig.RequestTimeout` set to a small test value
- **Given** the agent is already registered to DCM
- **When** DCM starts hanging on every registration request and a service-type change triggers
  re-registration
- **Then** multiple re-registration attempts MUST be observed by the mock within a window far
  shorter than the underlying HTTP client's own timeout — proving each attempt fails fast at the
  configured `RequestTimeout` and is retried via the backoff policy (REQ-DCM-050), rather than a
  single attempt blocking the registrar's event loop for the client's full timeout
- **Regression note:** this is the fix for qodo PR #38 round-2 finding #7 ("Service updates can
  stall for a minute"). The fix is deliberately symmetric — the same timeout applies to initial
  registration too (REQ-DCM-122) — because REQ-DCM-121/DD-560 require initial and re-registration
  attempts to behave identically; see `.ai/plans/2026-09-10_pr38-qodo-remediation_claude.md`

---

### IT-DCM-180: Registrar goroutine recovers from repeated panics and keeps retrying afterward

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-055
- **Test Infrastructure:** `panicNTimesLister` fake whose `AdvertisableServiceTypes` panics on its
  first 3 calls, then returns a real service type
- **Given** the registrar is started with this transiently-panicking lister
- **When** `run`'s prerequisite-gate loop calls `AdvertisableServiceTypes`, panicking 3 times before
  succeeding
- **Then** registration MUST eventually succeed against the mock DCM server (proving the goroutine
  survived all 3 panics and kept retrying, rather than exiting after the first one)
- **And** `Registrar.Done()` MUST NOT close merely because a panic was recovered — the goroutine
  MUST remain alive afterward (e.g. in its heartbeat loop)
- **And** `Registrar.Done()` MUST still close promptly on an actual shutdown (context cancellation)
- **Regression for:** a follow-up gap in the original version of this test: it used
  an unconditionally-panicking lister and asserted `Registrar.Done()` closing as the *success*
  condition — meaning it asserted exactly the bug it was meant to catch. Recovering a panic but
  letting the goroutine exit anyway "fixes" the process-crash half of the bug while leaving DCM
  registration silently, permanently stalled for the rest of the process lifetime — a regression
  this version of the test would have missed entirely, since it treated goroutine exit as correct.
  See `DD-360`

### IT-DCM-190: Registrar start/stop, heartbeat success, re-registration success logged

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-180
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM; `slog.Handler` capture in `registrar_integration_test.go`
- **Given** the registrar starts
- **When** its goroutine begins running
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted
- **Given** a heartbeat succeeds
- **When** it completes
- **Then** a DEBUG log MUST be emitted with `agent_id`, `consumer_lag`
- **Given** a service-type change triggers re-registration and it succeeds
- **When** it completes
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `agent_id`

---

### IT-DCM-195: Post-panic restart distinguishable from fresh start in the startup log

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-055
- **Test Infrastructure:** `slog.Handler` capture; `ServiceTypeLister` stub that panics once then
  behaves normally
- **Given** the registrar's dependency panics once, forcing the supervisor to recover and restart
  the registrar goroutine
- **When** both the initial startup and the post-panic restart emit a "DCM registrar starting" log
- **Then** the initial log MUST NOT carry a `restart_attempt` attribute
- **And** the restart's log MUST carry `restart_attempt >= 1`
- **And** the "panic in DCM registrar goroutine, restarting" log MUST carry the same
  `restart_attempt` value, so the two log lines can be cross-referenced

---

### IT-DCM-AUTH-010: Registration includes Authorization header (static mode)

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-190, AC-DCM-200
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server capturing `Authorization` header
- **Given** `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` is set to `"static-jwt"`
- **When** the agent registers with DCM
- **Then** the registration request MUST include `Authorization: Bearer static-jwt`

### IT-DCM-AUTH-020: Heartbeat includes Authorization header (static mode)

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-195, AC-DCM-200
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server capturing `Authorization` header
- **Given** `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` is set to `"static-jwt"`
- **When** the agent sends a heartbeat
- **Then** the heartbeat request MUST include `Authorization: Bearer static-jwt`

### IT-DCM-AUTH-030: Registration includes Authorization header (client-credentials mode)

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-190, AC-DCM-210
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server + mock OIDC token endpoint
- **Given** client-credentials config points at a mock token endpoint returning `{"access_token":"cc-jwt","expires_in":3600}`
- **When** the agent registers with DCM
- **Then** the registration request MUST include `Authorization: Bearer cc-jwt`

### IT-DCM-AUTH-030b: Registration uses the injected client-credentials token source even when a competing static token is also configured

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-210
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server + mock OIDC token endpoint
- **Given** client-credentials config is fully set AND a `TokenSource` built from client-credentials is injected directly into the registrar (bypassing `buildTokenSource`'s own precedence logic, which is unit-tested separately at TC-MAIN-UT-AUTH-030)
- **When** the agent registers with DCM
- **Then** the registration request MUST include the client-credentials-sourced `Authorization` header

### IT-DCM-AUTH-040: Token auto-refreshed during heartbeat loop (client-credentials, short expiry)

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-220
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server + mock OIDC token endpoint returning short-lived tokens (1s expiry)
- **Given** client-credentials mode with `expires_in=1`
- **When** the agent sends heartbeats over a period longer than the token lifetime
- **Then** the mock token endpoint MUST receive at least 2 token requests (initial + refresh)
- **And** the later heartbeat requests MUST carry a refreshed token

### IT-DCM-AUTH-050: No auth configured: no Authorization header on any request

- **Validates AC:** AC-DCM-235
- **Test Infrastructure:** mock DCM server capturing all headers
- **Given** neither `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` nor client-credentials env vars are set
- **When** the agent registers and sends heartbeats
- **Then** no request MUST include an `Authorization` header

---

## Topic 7: Messaging System Integration

### IT-MSG-010: Topic creation at startup

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Fresh JetStream; `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME="agent-prod-1"`
- **Given** no streams exist for `agent-prod-1*`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** JetStream MUST expose subjects for `agent-prod-1`, `agent-prod-1.retry`, `agent-prod-1.cancel`

---

### IT-MSG-011: Dotted topic name fails startup fast, not via indefinite JetStream retry

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-011
- **Test Infrastructure:** No real NATS server needed — the failure is a startup-time validation
  error raised before any messaging connection is attempted; `AGENT_NAME="agent-prod.1"`
- **Given** the agent is configured with a base name containing a dot
- **When** the agent starts (`run(ctx)`)
- **Then** `run` MUST return a non-zero exit code within ~2s
- **And** it MUST NOT ever reach `createRequestConsumer`'s 30s startup retry loop (REQ-MSG-051),
  which is what happened before `ValidateJetStreamSafeName` was wired into `setupMessaging` — the
  agent would pass `ValidateTopicName` (dots are valid subject tokens) and then hang, retrying
  stream/consumer creation forever without ever succeeding, since NATS rejects dots in
  stream/consumer names regardless of how long it retries

---

### IT-MSG-012: Too-long topic name fails startup fast, not via indefinite JetStream retry

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-011
- **Test Infrastructure:** No real NATS server needed — the failure is a startup-time validation
  error raised before any messaging connection is attempted; `AGENT_NAME` set to 240 `'a'` characters
- **Given** the agent is configured with a base name whose length alone (240 chars) already passes
  `ValidateTopicName`'s own 255-char limit, but which would exceed NATS's 255-char `JSMaxNameLen`
  once the `-cancel-consumer` suffix (16 chars) is appended for the derived JetStream consumer name
- **When** the agent starts (`run(ctx)`)
- **Then** `run` MUST return a non-zero exit code within ~2s
- **And** it MUST NOT ever reach `createRequestConsumer`'s 30s startup retry loop (REQ-MSG-051) —
  same failure class as IT-MSG-011, discovered via round 2 review: length, not just dots, can make
  a `ValidateTopicName`-valid base produce a JetStream-invalid derived name

---

### IT-MSG-020: Durable consumer creation on first start

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-015
- **Test Infrastructure:** Fresh JetStream
- **Given** no durable consumers exist
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** JetStream MUST list durable consumers with deterministic names derived from topic name

---

### IT-MSG-030: Consumer reuse on restart

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-016
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream with existing consumers; restart agent
- **Given** durable consumers exist from a prior session
- **When** the agent restarts
- **Then** the set of consumer names MUST be unchanged (no duplicates created)

---

### IT-MSG-040: Unacked message redelivered after crash

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-018
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream; SP mock that blocks forever; kill agent
- **Given** a message was delivered but not acked (SP call in-flight)
- **When** the agent is killed and restarted
- **Then** the unacknowledged message MUST be redelivered

---

### IT-MSG-050: Topic reuse on restart

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream with existing streams; restart agent
- **Given** topics already exist from a prior session
- **When** the agent restarts
- **Then** startup MUST succeed without errors (reuses existing topics)

---

### IT-MSG-060: Only main topic advertised to DCM

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-025
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM
- **Given** the agent registers to DCM
- **When** the registration payload is inspected
- **Then** `topicName` MUST be `"agent-prod-1"` (not retry or cancel variants)

---

### IT-MSG-070: Main topic consumption

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real NATS; Ready SP mock; responses subscriber
- **Given** the agent is running with a Ready SP for "database"
- **When** a `dcm.request.create` CloudEvent is published to `agent-prod-1`
- **Then** the SP mock MUST receive the create call
- **And** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive a `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` CloudEvent

---

### IT-MSG-080: Continuous cancel consumption updates deny list

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-035
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real NATS; Ready SP; cancel then create published
- **Given** the agent is running
- **When** a `dcm.request.cancel` for `resourceId="res-cancel-1"` is published to `agent-prod-1.cancel`
- **And** a `dcm.request.create` for `resourceId="res-cancel-1"` is published to `agent-prod-1`
- **Then** the SP MUST NOT receive a create for `res-cancel-1`

---

### IT-MSG-090: Cancel topic drained before main processing on startup

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream pre-seeded with cancel and create for same resource
- **Given** cancel topic has cancel for `resourceId="res-drain-1"` and main topic has create for same
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the create MUST be dropped (deny list populated from cancel drain first)

---

### IT-MSG-095: Cancel topic drain timeout

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream; cancel topic with many messages; slow consumer simulation
- **Given** the cancel topic contains a large number of messages that cannot all be consumed within 5s
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** drain MUST complete within the 5s timeout window
- **And** main topic processing MUST begin after the timeout
- **And** only cancels consumed within the window MUST populate the deny list

---

### IT-MSG-140: In-flight handler finishes and acks before Stop closes the connection

- **Validates AC:** none — no existing REQ/AC covers messaging-client shutdown quiescing
  (REQ-HTTP-030/040 cover only the HTTP server's graceful shutdown); this hardening fix is
  scoped directly to the bug described below
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` with a main handler that sleeps to simulate
  in-flight work; independent test connection to inspect consumer state directly
- **Given** a create CE has been delivered and its handler is actively sleeping (in-flight)
- **When** `Stop` is called while the handler is still running
- **Then** `Stop` MUST wait for the handler to finish (bounded by `shutdownDrainTimeout`)
  rather than returning immediately
- **And** the message MUST have been acked before the NATS connection closes — the durable
  consumer's `NumPending + NumAckPending` MUST be 0 afterward, not left ack-pending for
  server-side redelivery
- **Regression for:** `Stop` previously called `ConsumeContext.Stop()` (discards
  buffered messages, no wait) and closed
  the NATS connection immediately, so an in-flight handler's own `Ack`/`Nak` call could lose
  the race against connection teardown, forcing redelivery (and duplicate side effects, e.g.
  a second response CE) on the next restart. `Stop` now calls `ConsumeContext.Drain()` and
  waits (bounded) for each consumer's `Closed()` channel before closing the connection.
  Also fixes the shutdown *ordering* in `cmd/environment-agent/main.go`: `retry.Processor.
  Stop()` previously ran before `messaging.Client.Stop()` under plain LIFO `defer` ordering
  (deliberately reversed via a combined `defer` closure so messaging quiesces first).

---

### IT-MSG-130: DeferConsume holds live consumption until StartConsuming

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-040 (extends the drain-ordering guarantee to the composition root's
  restart-drain sequencing)
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` constructed with `ClientConfig.DeferConsume: true`
- **Given** the client has started (durable main/cancel consumers created, initial cancel-topic
  drain complete) but `StartConsuming` has not yet been called
- **When** a create CE is published to the main topic
- **Then** the message MUST remain pending on the durable consumer (`NumPending` stays 1) —
  no live `Consume()` loop may claim it
- **When** `StartConsuming` is subsequently called
- **Then** the previously-pending message MUST be delivered to the main handler
- **Regression for:** without `DeferConsume`, `retry.Processor.ProcessOnRestart`'s
  own `Fetch` calls against the same durable
  consumers (called from `main.go` after `messaging.Client.Start`) could race an
  already-running `Consume()` for the same messages, diverting them onto `routeMessage` and
  bypassing `handleMainMessage`'s `MaxDeliver`/handler-timeout envelope. The composition root
  (`cmd/environment-agent/main.go`) sets `DeferConsume: true` and calls `StartConsuming` only
  after `ProcessOnRestart` completes, making the two Fetch-based drains (`ProcessOnRestart`) and
  the live pull-consumers mutually exclusive by construction instead of by timing luck.

---

### IT-MSG-131: onSetupReady fires against real JetStream; StartConsuming from inside it begins live consumption

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-047
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` constructed with `ClientConfig.DeferConsume: true`,
  real embedded NATS/JetStream server (same suite as IT-MSG-130)
- **Given** `SetOnSetupReady` is registered with a callback that mirrors `main.go`'s real shape:
  synchronously call `StartConsuming()` (standing in for `main.go`'s
  `retryProcessor.ProcessOnRestart` + `StartConsuming` pair)
- **When** `Start` is called
- **Then** the `onSetupReady` callback MUST fire exactly once, after real JetStream
  streams/durable consumers have been created
- **And** the `StartConsuming()` call made from inside that callback MUST actually begin live
  consumption — a message published to the main topic afterward MUST be delivered to the main
  handler
- **Regression for:** the only prior test coverage of `SetOnSetupReady`
  (`client_onsetupready_test.go`'s `TestSetupStreamsAndConsume_...`) used fake
  consumers and never exercised the real `setupStreamsAndConsume`/`finishSetup` code path against
  an actual NATS connection; this closes that gap with the same real-NATS harness IT-MSG-130
  already uses.

---

### IT-MSG-100: Messaging failure does not block HTTP; reconnects

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Agent with unreachable NATS URL
- **Given** the messaging system is unreachable at startup
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` MUST return 200 promptly
- **And** after NATS becomes available, the agent MUST reconnect and consume messages

---

### IT-MSG-105: Processes messages after delayed NATS start — setup completes on connect

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` started before any NATS server is listening; real
  JetStream server started afterward on the same address
- **Given** `Start` is called while NATS is unreachable
- **When** a real NATS/JetStream server later starts listening on that address
- **Then** the client MUST connect, complete setup (streams + consumers), and reach `IsConnected() == true`
- **And** a CloudEvent published to the main subject afterward MUST be delivered to the main handler
  — a deeper, full end-to-end proof than IT-MSG-100's HTTP-availability check alone

---

### IT-MSG-107: Creates consumers once the CP request stream appears mid-retry

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-012
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real NATS server (no JetStream stream pre-created); dynamic port
- **Given** NATS is already reachable but the control-plane-owned `dcm-agent-requests` stream does
  not exist yet, forcing `createRequestConsumer`'s inner retry loop (REQ-MSG-051)
- **When** the stream is created later, while the agent's retry loop is still polling
- **Then** the agent MUST detect the stream, successfully create its durable consumer, and begin
  consuming — with no restart or manual intervention required

---

### IT-MSG-110: Ack only after routing outcome finalized

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-055
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream; SP mock with delayed response
- **Given** a create message is consumed and SP has not yet responded
- **When** routing is still in-flight
- **Then** the message MUST remain unacknowledged
- **And** after SP returns, the message MUST be acknowledged

---

### IT-MSG-120: Response CloudEvents include correlation fields

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** Ready SP; NATS subscriber on `dcm.agents.responses`
- **Given** the agent routes a create successfully
- **When** the response CloudEvent is observed
- **Then** it MUST conform to CloudEvents v1.0
- **And** `data` MUST include `agentName` and `topicName`
- **And** MUST be published to `dcm.agents.responses`

---

### IT-MSG-160: Nats-Msg-Id header set on the wire

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-065
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real embedded NATS/JetStream server; dedicated per-test stream/subject; raw JetStream consumer (bypassing `messaging.Client`'s own fakes/stubs)
- **Given** `messaging.Client.PublishWithMsgID` is called with a subject, a msg ID, and a payload
- **When** a raw JetStream consumer fetches the resulting message directly from the stream
- **Then** the message's `Nats-Msg-Id` header MUST equal the caller's msg ID, confirming the header is set at the wire level and not just constructed in memory

### IT-MSG-161: JetStream server-side dedup drops repeated Nats-Msg-Id

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-065
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real embedded NATS/JetStream server; dedicated per-test stream with an explicit `Duplicates` window
- **Given** `PublishWithMsgID` is called twice with the same subject and msg ID but different payloads
- **When** the stream's message count is inspected afterward
- **Then** it MUST equal 1 (the second publish was deduplicated server-side by NATS), confirming the header round-trips correctly for real dedup, not just that no error is returned

---

### IT-MSG-071: Nested CE payload — resourceId extracted correctly

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS JetStream; nested JSON payload with `spec` object
- **Given** a CloudEvent with nested payload `{"resourceId":"res-nested","spec":{"replicas":3}}`
- **When** the message is consumed on the main topic
- **Then** `resourceId` MUST be extracted correctly (struct ignores nested fields)
- **And** the response CE MUST include the extracted `resourceId`
- **And** a nested cancel payload MUST correctly populate the deny list

### IT-MSG-072: Delete request produces deletion-acknowledged response

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS JetStream; responses subscriber
- **Given** a `dcm.request.delete` CloudEvent is published to the main topic
- **When** the handler returns nil (success)
- **Then** the response CE type MUST be `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged`
- **And** the response CE data MUST include `status: "DELETING"`

### IT-MSG-073: publishResponseCE failure causes nak and redelivery

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-055
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS JetStream; client with empty AgentName
- **Given** a client created with empty `AgentName` (FormatSource will fail)
- **When** a valid message is consumed and handler returns nil
- **Then** `publishResponseCE` MUST fail (FormatSource error)
- **And** the message MUST be nak'd
- **And** JetStream MUST redeliver the message (delivery count >= 2)

### IT-MSG-170: Message receipt logged on main and cancel subjects

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-160
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS JetStream; `slog.Handler` capture (extend `handlers_test.go`'s `captureHandler`)
- **Given** a CloudEvent is published to the main subject
- **When** `handleMainMessage` begins processing it
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `subject`, `stream_seq`, `consumer_seq`, `num_delivered`
- **And** the same MUST hold for `handleCancelMessage` on the cancel subject

### IT-MSG-171: Message resolution (ack/nak) logged

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-170
- **Test Infrastructure:** Same capture-handler setup as IT-MSG-170
- **Given** a main-topic message whose handler returns nil
- **When** `msg.Ack()` succeeds
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `subject`
- **Given** a main-topic message whose handler returns an error
- **When** `msg.NakWithDelay` succeeds
- **Then** a WARN log MUST be emitted with `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `subject`, `error`

### IT-MSG-172: Messaging ready and stopped logged

- **Validates AC:** AC-MSG-180
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real embedded NATS/JetStream server; `slog.Handler` capture
- **Given** the messaging client starts and JetStream setup succeeds

- **Then** the second attempt MUST be forwarded to the SP
- **And** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` with `status="PROVISIONING"`

---

### IT-RTE-160: Context cancellation suppresses error CE after SP failure

- **Validates AC:** AC-RTE-135
- **Test Infrastructure:** External SP returning a retryable error; caller context cancelled before dispatch
- **Given** the SP would return a retryable error
- **And** the caller's context is already cancelled
- **When** `HandleRequest` is invoked
- **Then** it MUST return `context.Canceled`
- **And** no `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent MUST be published

---

### IT-RTE-165: Cancel during startup window with no retry consumer

- **Validates AC:** AC-RTE-085
- **Test Infrastructure:** Router constructed without a `RetryConsumer` wired (startup window)
- **Given** the retry-topic consumer has not yet been wired into the router
- **And** a cancel CloudEvent arrives for a `resourceId` never previously seen
- **When** `HandleCancel` is invoked

- **Then** the deletion MUST be forwarded to the SP
- **And** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged` with `status="DELETING"`

---

### IT-RTE-180: Concurrent duplicate forward blocked, legitimate one not

- **Validates AC:** AC-RTE-210

- **Given** a forward attempt for `resourceId="res-race"` is in flight (gated SP call not yet returned)
- **When** a second, concurrent forward attempt for the same `resourceId` arrives
- **Then** the second attempt MUST return `routing.ErrForwardInFlight`
- **And** the SP MUST NOT receive a second concurrent call for that `resourceId`
- **Given** the first attempt is then released and completes successfully
- **When** a subsequent deletion request for the same `resourceId` arrives
- **Then** it MUST NOT be blocked by the in-flight lock

---

### IT-RTE-140: CloudEvent publish outcome logged

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-140
- **Test Infrastructure:** No real NATS needed — a fake `Publisher` stub (configurable error) lets
  the failure path be forced deterministically; `slog.Handler` capture in
  `router_publish_logging_test.go`, exercised via `Router.HandleCancel` (the cheapest public path
  that reaches `publishCE`)
- **Given** `Router.publishCE` is called and the publish succeeds
- **When** the CE is published
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `ce_type`, `resource_id`
- **Given** the publish fails (e.g. publisher returns an error)
- **When** the publish attempt fails
- **Then** a WARN log MUST be emitted with `ce_type`, `resource_id`, `error`
- **Found via traceability audit:** this AC previously had no dedicated test anywhere — the
  success path was only incidentally, non-specifically touched by `IT-XC-LOG-030`, and the
  failure/WARN path was entirely untested

### IT-RTE-141: SP dispatch outcome logged, no request/response body leaked

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-150
- **Test Infrastructure:** `slog.Handler` capture in `forwarder_test.go`; mock external SP HTTP server; embedded SP stub
- **Given** a create or delete dispatch to an SP completes, successfully or not, for both embedded and external providers
- **When** `Forwarder.CreateResource`/`DeleteResource` returns
- **Then** a log MUST be emitted (INFO on success, WARN on failure) with `resource_id`, `service_type`, provider kind, `operation`, `duration`
- **And** a failed external dispatch's log MUST include `http_status`
- **And** no log entry MUST contain the request spec payload or the HTTP response body

### IT-RTE-142: Deny-list drop and retry-topic purge summary logged

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-160
- **Test Infrastructure:** Implemented as captured-log extensions of IT-RTE-100 and IT-RTE-120
  in-place (same scenarios, no separate test case needed)
- **Given** a create request is dropped because its `resource_id` is on the deny list
- **When** it is dropped
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `resource_id` (asserted in IT-RTE-100)
- **Given** a cancel is processed while other resources are present in the retry topic
- **When** the retry-topic purge for that cancel completes
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `resource_id`, `matched`, `requeued` (asserted in IT-RTE-120)

---

## Topic 9: Retry & Cancel Mechanisms

### IT-RCM-010: SP recovers — retry topic processed

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS; retry topic with 3 creates; SP transitions to Ready
- **Given** retry topic contains creates for `res-a`, `res-b`, `res-c` (serviceType="database")
- **And** SP for "database" is Unhealthy
- **When** SP transitions to Ready
- **Then** SP MUST receive creates for all three resources
- **And** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive three `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` events
- **And** forwarded payloads MUST be original CE bytes (no wrapping)

---

### IT-RCM-020: SP becomes Unavailable — held requests rejected

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS; retry topic with 2 creates; SP becomes Unavailable
- **Given** retry topic contains creates for `res-d1`, `res-d2` (serviceType="database")
- **When** SP transitions to Unavailable
- **Then** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive two `dcm.agent.error` events
- **And** SP MUST NOT receive calls for them

---

### IT-RCM-030: Mixed service types — reject Unavailable, requeue Unhealthy

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Two SPs; retry topic with mixed types; responses subscriber
- **Given** retry topic has create for "database" (SP Unhealthy) and "container" (SP Unavailable)
- **When** retry processing triggers
- **Then** "container" request MUST be rejected with error CE
- **And** "database" request MUST remain queued in the retry topic
- **And** no additional `dcm.agent.request-queued` CEs MUST be published for "database"

---

### IT-RCM-045: Stale Unavailable notification re-checks current health (health-toctou-guard)

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-020, AC-RCM-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** NATS; retry topic with 1 create; health tracker updated to
  Ready *after* queuing but the transition is invoked with a stale `to=Unavailable`
- **Given** the retry topic contains a create for "database"
- **And** the SP for "database" is currently Ready (per the health tracker)
- **When** `ProcessOnTransition` is invoked with `to=Unavailable` (a stale/delayed
  notification — `RunTransition` backgrounds this call, so `to` can lag reality)
- **Then** the item MUST be forwarded to the SP (not rejected with an error CE),
  because `processTransitionItems` re-resolves the service type's CURRENT status
  rather than trusting the stale `to` parameter
- **Regression for:** the `health-toctou-guard` bug

---

### IT-RCM-040: FIFO ordering per service type

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-040
- **Test Infrastructure:** SP mock recording order; retry topic seeded A→B→C
- **Given** retry topic contains creates for "database" in order: A, B, C
- **When** SP recovers to Ready
- **Then** SP invocation order MUST be A, B, C

---

### IT-RCM-050: Restart re-reads retry without extra request-queued CEs

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-045
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream; SP remains Unhealthy; restart agent
- **Given** retry topic has messages from prior session; initial `request-queued` CEs already published
- **When** the agent restarts
- **Then** no additional `dcm.agent.request-queued` CEs MUST be published
- **And** messages MUST remain held until Ready/Unavailable transition

---

### IT-RCM-060: Creation-deletion dedup in retry topic

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Retry topic with both create and delete for same resource
- **Given** retry topic contains `dcm.request.create` and `dcm.request.delete` for `resourceId="res-123"`
- **When** retry topic is processed
- **Then** neither MUST be forwarded to SP
- **And** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged` with `status="DELETED"`
- **And** both messages MUST be acknowledged
- **And** the dedup MUST be logged

---

### IT-RCM-070: Cancel topic drained at startup

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-060
- **Test Infrastructure:** JetStream; cancel topic seeded; main topic with matching creates; Ready SP
- **Given** cancel topic has cancels for `res-456` and `res-789`
- **And** main topic has creates for both
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** both cancels MUST be consumed before creates are forwarded
- **And** SP MUST NOT receive creates for `res-456` or `res-789`

---

### IT-RCM-080: Terminal error CE published when MaxDeliver exceeded

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-070
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` with `MaxDeliver=3`; main-topic handler that always errors
- **Given** `AGENT_MESSAGING_MAX_DELIVER=3` and a creation request whose handler fails every attempt
- **When** the message has been delivered 3 times without acknowledgment
- **Then** `dcm.agents.responses` MUST receive `dcm.agent.error` with `error: "MAX_DELIVERY_EXCEEDED"`
- **And** the handler MUST NOT be invoked more than 3 times
- **And** the message MUST be terminated (no pending/ack-pending redelivery left)

---

### IT-RCM-090: Main consumer uses configured MaxDeliver; retry/cancel consumers have none

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-080
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` started against real JetStream; consumer info inspected directly
- **Given** `AGENT_MESSAGING_MAX_DELIVER=7`
- **When** the agent creates its durable consumers at startup
- **Then** the main-subject consumer MUST be configured with `MaxDeliver=7`
- **And** the retry-subject consumer MUST be configured with `MaxDeliver=-1` (unlimited, per DD-410)
- **And** the cancel-subject consumer MUST be configured with `MaxDeliver=-1` (unlimited)

---

### IT-RCM-095: Retry-topic Nak-in-place increments JetStream delivery count

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-080 (the retry-subject consumer's no-`MaxDeliver` config, asserted by
  IT-RCM-090, is only safe because Nak-in-place actually preserves delivery count instead of
  resetting it — this test proves that underlying, load-bearing behavior; see DD-410)
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real JetStream retry stream/consumer; the production retry-fetch path (not a fake consumer)
- **Given** a create request for a resourceId is published to the real retry-topic stream
- **And** it is fetched once through the retry-topic consumer (delivery count == 1)
- **When** the fetched message is Nak'd in place (not acked-and-republished) and redelivered
- **Then** the redelivered message MUST report delivery count == 2, not reset to 1
- **And** the message MUST be the same retry-topic message (same stream sequence number), not a
  duplicate republished copy

---

### IT-RCM-100: Hung SP call aborted after handler deadline elapses

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` with `HandlerTimeout`; SP forwarder that hangs until context cancellation
- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT=1s` and an SP that never responds
- **When** 1s elapses without a response
- **Then** the in-flight SP call's context MUST be cancelled
- **And** the message MUST NOT be acknowledged (remains pending/ack-pending for redelivery)

---

### IT-RCM-110: Handler deadline is applied to SP call context

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-100
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` with `HandlerTimeout`; SP forwarder capturing the context deadline it received
- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT=2.5s`
- **When** the agent begins processing a message consumed from the main topic
- **Then** the context passed to the SP call MUST carry a deadline ~2.5s from invocation

---

### IT-RCM-115: Handler deadline enforced on transition-path (retry-topic) forwarding

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-090
- **Test Infrastructure:** `retry.Processor` with `HandlerTimeout`; SP forwarder that hangs until context cancellation; `ProcessOnTransition`
- **Given** a retry-topic message and an SP forwarder that never responds
- **When** the SP transitions to Ready and `ProcessOnTransition` forwards the queued message
- **Then** the SP call's context MUST be cancelled once the handler deadline elapses

---

### IT-RCM-120: Idempotency-Key (CE id) forwarded to external SP

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-110
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` + `Router`; `FakeSPForwarder` recording received requests
- **Given** an inbound `dcm.request.create` CloudEvent with `id="ce-idem-1"`
- **When** the agent forwards the request to the external SP
- **Then** the SP call MUST receive `"ce-idem-1"` as the request's `EventID`

---

### IT-RCM-130: Idempotency-Key stable across in-line retry attempts

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-120
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` + `Router`; SP forwarder failing the first 2 attempts
- **Given** an inbound CloudEvent with `id="ce-idem-2"` that triggers 2 retryable SP errors before succeeding
- **When** the agent retries the forward in-line
- **Then** all 3 SP calls MUST carry `EventID="ce-idem-2"`

---

### IT-RCM-140: Idempotency-Key stable across retry-topic reprocessing

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-120
- **Test Infrastructure:** `retry.Processor`; message published directly to the retry topic; `ProcessOnTransition`
- **Given** an inbound CloudEvent with `id="ce-idem-3"` queued in the retry topic
- **When** the SP transitions to Ready and the retry processor forwards it
- **Then** the SP call MUST carry `EventID="ce-idem-3"`

---

### IT-RCM-150: Idempotency-Key available to embedded SPs via request

- **Validates AC:** AC-RCM-130
- **Test Infrastructure:** `messaging.Client` + `Router`; embedded SP fake registered via `routingtest.RegisterEmbeddedSP`
- **Given** an embedded SP registered and Ready for service type "container"
- **And** an inbound CloudEvent with `id="ce-idem-4"` requesting creation of a "container" resource
- **When** the agent forwards the request via in-process call
- **Then** the embedded SP call MUST receive `"ce-idem-4"` as the CE id

---

### IT-RCM-160: Cross-path in-flight guard blocks retry-topic double-dispatch

- **Validates AC:** AC-RTE-210
- **Test Infrastructure:** `Router` and `retry.Processor` sharing one `InFlightSet` (as wired in `main.go`); `GatedSPForwarder`; same `resourceId` present on both main and retry topics
- **Given** a forward for `resourceId="res-cross-race"` is in flight via the router (gated SP call not yet returned)
- **And** the same `resourceId`'s message also lives on the retry topic
- **When** the SP transitions to Ready and the retry processor concurrently attempts to forward the same `resourceId`
- **Then** the SP MUST NOT receive a second concurrent call for that `resourceId`
- **And** the retry-topic message MUST be Nak'd (deferred), not lost or double-dispatched
- **And** once the router's in-flight attempt completes, the retry-topic message remains eligible for a later successful forward

---

> **Retired (DD-410):** `IT-RCM-085`/`IT-RCM-086` (retry-topic `MaxDeliver`-exceeded
> termination and its logging parity) were removed — the retry-subject consumer no
> longer sets `MaxDeliver` at all, so this guard is no longer applicable. See DD-410
> and REQ-RCM-150.

## Cross-Cutting: Error Handling

### IT-XC-ERR-010: RFC 9457 compliance across error conditions

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-ERR-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** any error condition in the API (404, 409, 422, 500)
- **When** the error response is returned
- **Then** the body MUST contain at minimum `type` and `title` fields
- **And** SHOULD include `detail` and `instance` (= request URI)

---

### IT-XC-ERR-020: Error content type

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-ERR-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server
- **Given** any error response is returned
- **When** the headers are inspected
- **Then** `Content-Type` MUST be `application/problem+json`

---

### IT-XC-ERR-030: No implementation detail leakage

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-ERR-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, trigger internal error
- **Given** an internal error occurs (e.g., via fault injection)
- **When** the HTTP 500 response is returned
- **Then** the `detail` MUST be a static non-revealing message
- **And** the response MUST NOT contain stack traces, file paths, or internal error messages

---

## Cross-Cutting: CloudEvent Definitions

### IT-XC-CE-010: CloudEvent v1.0 compliance

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CE-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Any routing path producing a response CE; NATS subscriber
- **Given** the agent publishes any CloudEvent
- **When** the event is inspected
- **Then** it MUST include `id` (unique), `source`, `type`, `time` (RFC 3339), `specversion="1.0"`

---

### IT-XC-CE-020: Source attribute format

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CE-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Mock DCM returning `agentId="agent-123"`; responses subscriber
- **Given** the agent registered with `agentId="agent-123"`
- **When** any agent-originated CloudEvent is published
- **Then** `source` MUST equal `"dcm/agents/agent-123"`

---

## Cross-Cutting: Logging

### IT-XC-LOG-010: Structured JSON logging

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-LOG-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Real HTTP server, log capture
- **Given** any operation occurs
- **When** the operation is logged
- **Then** log output MUST be JSON with fields: `time` (RFC 3339), `level`, `msg`

---

### IT-XC-LOG-020: Log levels follow convention

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-LOG-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Log capture across various scenarios
- **Given** various operations occur (error, warning, lifecycle events)
- **When** logs are inspected
- **Then** unrecoverable failures MUST use ERROR level
- **And** recoverable issues (retries, SP health transitions) MUST use WARN
- **And** lifecycle events (startup, SP registration) MUST use INFO

---

### IT-XC-LOG-030: Canonical correlation field names across log sites

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-LOG-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** `slog.Handler` capture spanning a full resource lifecycle (receive, dispatch, publish) and an SP registration, asserting across the accumulated log records
- **Given** a create request flows through receipt, dispatch, and response-publish, and an SP registers
- **When** the accumulated log records are inspected
- **Then** every resource/CE/service-type/provider correlation field key MUST be one of `resource_id`, `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `service_type`, `provider_id`
- **And** none MUST use a camelCase variant (`resourceId`, `ceId`, `providerID`, etc.)

---

## Cross-Cutting: Configuration Management

### IT-XC-CFG-010: Environment variable configuration

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-010
- **Test Infrastructure:** Agent startup with env vars
- **Given** `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090` is set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the server MUST listen on port 9090

---

### IT-XC-CFG-020: Configuration file loading

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-011
- **Test Infrastructure:** `config.Load()` called directly with `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE` pointing at a
  temp `.env`-style file
- **Given** the config file provides `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090`
- **And** `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS` is not set in the real environment
- **When** `config.Load()` is called
- **Then** `cfg.Server.Address` MUST be `:9090`
- **Note:** unit-tested directly against `config.Load()` (a pure function of its inputs) rather than
  through a full agent-startup integration test — see `UT-XC-CFG-060` in `unit-tests.md`.

---

### IT-XC-CFG-030: Environment variable takes precedence over file

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-012
- **Test Infrastructure:** `config.Load()` called directly
- **Given** the config file provides `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090`
- **And** `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:7070` is also set in the real environment
- **When** `config.Load()` is called
- **Then** `cfg.Server.Address` MUST be `:7070` (environment variable wins)
- **Note:** unit-tested — see `UT-XC-CFG-061`. Same provenance as IT-XC-CFG-020 above: no
  backing Go test existed until this fix.

---

### IT-XC-CFG-040: Fail-fast on missing required config

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-020
- **Test Infrastructure:** Agent startup without required config
- **Given** `AGENT_NAME` is absent or empty
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST exit before starting the HTTP server
- **And** MUST log an error identifying the missing field

---

### IT-XC-CFG-050: Fail-fast on invalid AGENT_COST

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-030
- **Test Infrastructure:** Agent startup with invalid cost
- **Given** `AGENT_COST="expensive"`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST exit before starting any subsystem
- **And** MUST log an error identifying the invalid value

---

### IT-XC-CFG-060: Invalid config range fails fast

- **Validates AC:** AC-XC-CFG-050
- **Test Infrastructure:** Agent startup with out-of-range value
- **Given** `AGENT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=0ms` (below minimum 1s)
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST exit with an error identifying the invalid value and valid range

---

## Container Status Monitoring — Stuck Rollout

> **ID convention note:** this package's test files (`reconcile_integration_test.go`,
> `reconcile_unit_test.go`, `debounce_integration_test.go`) have always used a `TC-U0xx` (unit) /
> `TC-I1xx` (integration) comment convention, distinct from the `UT-XXX-NNN`/`IT-XXX-NNN`
> convention used elsewhere in this doc. The rows below intentionally keep the `TC-` IDs to stay
> consistent with the code's own comments — this is not an oversight. IDs continue from the
> existing `TC-I044`–`TC-I046`/`TC-I062`–`TC-I065`/`TC-I113`–`TC-I114` cases in
> `reconcile_integration_test.go`; `TC-I115` is used in `debounce_integration_test.go` in the same
> package, so `TC-I120`/`TC-I121` are the next free IDs.

### TC-I120: Publisher receives FAILED when Deployment reaches ProgressDeadlineExceeded

- **Validates AC:** AC-CNT-500
- **Test Infrastructure:** `monitoring.StatusMonitor` against a fake clientset
  (`k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/fake`), using the test file's existing `createDeployment`/
  `createPod` helpers and `mockStatusPublisher`
- **Given** a Deployment named `"my-app"` and a Pod named `"my-app-pod"` for instance ID
  `"abc-123"` are created via `createDeployment("my-app", "abc-123")` and
  `createPod("my-app-pod", "abc-123", corev1.PodPending)`
- **When** the Deployment is subsequently fetched and its status updated via `UpdateStatus` to
  set `Status.Conditions` to exactly
  `[]appsv1.DeploymentCondition{{Type: appsv1.DeploymentProgressing, Status: corev1.ConditionFalse, Reason: "ProgressDeadlineExceeded", Message: "ReplicaSet \"my-app-abc123\" has timed out progressing."}}`
  (mirroring the TC-U080 condition shape, adapted to this test's Deployment name), and the test
  waits for reconciliation (the file's existing `500 * time.Millisecond` sleep pattern, e.g. as
  used after the TC-I045 status update)
- **Then** `publisher.Events()` MUST eventually contain an event with `InstanceID == "abc-123"`
  and `Status == v1alpha1.FAILED`
- **Mirrors:** the real image-pull-failure shape end-to-end through the Deployment informer
  (Pod present, stuck rather than the pre-fix Pod-phase-only path)

---

### TC-I121: Publisher's last event flips to RUNNING when the rollout recovers (no latch)

- **Validates AC:** AC-CNT-501
- **Test Infrastructure:** same as TC-I120, continuing from its end-state (last published event
  for instance `"abc-123"` is `FAILED`)
- **Given** the TC-I120 end-state (Deployment `"my-app"` / Pod `"my-app-pod"` for instance
  `"abc-123"`, last published event `Status == v1alpha1.FAILED`)
- **When** the Deployment's condition is updated via `UpdateStatus` to
  `[]appsv1.DeploymentCondition{{Type: appsv1.DeploymentProgressing, Status: corev1.ConditionTrue}}`
  (rollout recovered, no `Reason`/`Message`), AND the Pod's phase is updated via `UpdateStatus` to
  `corev1.PodRunning`, and the test again waits for reconciliation (`500 * time.Millisecond`)
- **Then** the publisher's LAST event for instance `"abc-123"` MUST have `Status == v1alpha1.RUNNING`
- **And** it MUST NOT remain latched at `Status == v1alpha1.FAILED`
- **Proves:** D3/AC-CNT-501 (no-latch) end-to-end — the reconciliation loop reflects live cluster
  state on every event, mirroring the existing TC-I113/TC-I114 "last event wins" assertion style

See also UT-MSG-080, UT-MSG-090, and UT-MSG-095 (`finishSetup` must not report success when `beginConsuming` fails after the callback runs) in `.ai/test-plans/unit-tests.md`. `main.go`'s own composition-root wiring of `SetOnSetupReady` specifically (as opposed to `messaging.Client`'s side of the contract) is still not exercised by an end-to-end test — a genuine "NATS unreachable at Start()" integration scenario would require controlling the test NATS server's startup ordering relative to the agent process, which the current test harness (shared `testNATSServer` started before any client) doesn't support |
