# Specification: Environment Agent

## 1. Overview

The Environment Agent is a lightweight process that runs in a target environment,
acting as the intermediary between the DCM Control Plane and Service Providers
deployed in that environment. It registers the environment to DCM, consumes
resource operation requests from a messaging system, and routes them to the
appropriate Service Provider.

The agent supports a hybrid SP model: it ships with embedded SP code (enabled via
configuration) and also accepts external ("bring your own") SPs that register via
REST API. Only one SP — embedded or external — may serve a given service type per
agent; duplicate registrations are rejected.

**Initial scope (v1alpha1):**

- Single agent instance per environment (no HA / competing consumers)
- One SP per service type (no multi-SP selection strategies)
- Creation and deletion operations only (no update/day-2 operations)
- External SP authentication via JWT Bearer tokens validated against Keycloak OIDC (see §4.11); auth can be disabled for development
- No hot-reload of agent configuration (restart required for config changes)
- SP un-registration process not yet designed (periodic re-registration is accepted but no consequences defined for non-renewal in v1alpha1)

## 4. Topic Specifications

### 4.1 HTTP Server

#### Overview

Foundation layer: HTTP server with graceful shutdown, signal handling,
configuration loading from environment variables, and route registration for all
OpenAPI-defined endpoints. All endpoints are under `/api/v1alpha1`.

Out of scope: TLS termination (handled by infrastructure/ingress),
rate limiting. Authentication middleware is specified in §4.11.

### 4.2 Health Service

#### Overview

Implementation of the `/api/v1alpha1/health` endpoint as defined in the OpenAPI
spec. This endpoint reports whether the agent process is alive. DCM does not poll
this endpoint directly (it uses heartbeats for agent liveness); this endpoint
serves infrastructure health checks (e.g., Kubernetes liveness probes).

> **Note:** This endpoint originates from the OpenAPI spec (`api/v1alpha1/openapi.yaml`)
> rather than the enhancement document. The enhancement defines only `/providers`;
> the health endpoint was added for infrastructure compatibility.

Out of scope: Dependency health aggregation (SP health is reported via
`GET /api/v1alpha1/providers`).

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-HLT-010 | The agent MUST expose `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` and return HTTP 200 OK when the agent process is running | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-020 | The health response MUST return a JSON body conforming to the Health schema with `status` and `path` fields | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-030 | The `status` field MUST be `"healthy"` when the agent is operational: the HTTP server is accepting connections AND the messaging system is connected | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-040 | The `status` field MUST be `"unhealthy"` when the messaging system is disconnected | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-050 | The `path` field MUST be `"health"` | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-060 | The response MUST set `Content-Type: application/json` | MUST | |
| REQ-HLT-070 | The health endpoint MUST return within 5ms from in-memory state with no network I/O or disk reads | MUST | |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-HLT-010: Health endpoint availability

- **Validates:** REQ-HLT-010
- **Given** the HTTP server is running
- **When** a GET request is made to `/api/v1alpha1/health`
- **Then** the agent MUST return HTTP 200 OK

##### AC-HLT-020: Health response body — healthy

- **Validates:** REQ-HLT-020, REQ-HLT-030, REQ-HLT-050
- **Given** the agent is operational and the messaging system is connected
- **When** GET `/api/v1alpha1/health` is called
- **Then** the response body MUST contain:
  - `status`: `"healthy"`
  - `path`: `"health"`

##### AC-HLT-030: Health response body — unhealthy

- **Validates:** REQ-HLT-020, REQ-HLT-040
- **Given** the agent is running but the messaging system is disconnected
- **When** GET `/api/v1alpha1/health` is called
- **Then** the response MUST be HTTP 200 OK
- **And** the response body MUST contain `status`: `"unhealthy"`

##### AC-HLT-040: Content type

- **Validates:** REQ-HLT-060
- **Given** any call to the health endpoint
- **When** the response is returned
- **Then** the `Content-Type` header MUST be `application/json`

##### AC-HLT-050: Health endpoint performs no blocking I/O

- **Validates:** REQ-HLT-070
- **Given** the agent is running but external dependencies (messaging system) are unreachable
- **When** `GET /api/v1alpha1/health` is called
- **Then** the endpoint MUST return a response without blocking or timing out
- **And** the response MUST be derived solely from in-memory state

#### Dependencies

Depends on Topic 1 (HTTP Server).

### 4.3 SP Registration & Management

#### Overview

The agent manages a registry of Service Providers. Embedded SPs are registered
at startup via configuration. External SPs register via REST API
(`POST /api/v1alpha1/providers`). Only one SP may serve a given service type.
The registry is persisted to local storage to survive restarts.

Out of scope: Multiple SPs per service type with selection strategies.
Authentication of external SP registration requests is handled by §4.11.

#### Requirements — Embedded SP Registration

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-SPR-010 | The agent MUST support configuring embedded SPs via environment variables or configuration file | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-020 | Each embedded SP MUST be explicitly enabled in configuration before it becomes active | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-030 | At startup, the agent MUST register only the embedded SPs that are explicitly enabled in configuration | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-040 | Embedded SP registration MUST be performed in-process without a REST call | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-050 | If an embedded SP's service type is already occupied by a persisted external SP registration (from a prior session), the embedded SP registration for that service type MUST be skipped | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-051 | When an embedded SP registration is skipped due to slot conflict, the agent MUST log a warning and continue startup without failing; the skipped SP MUST NOT prevent other SPs from registering or the agent from becoming operational (HTTP server listening, messaging system connection initiated, health checks running) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-052 | When registering an embedded SP for a service type that has a prior persisted *embedded* record, the agent MUST preserve that record's provider ID and `create_time` rather than generating new ones, so the provider's identity is stable across restarts. If no such prior embedded record exists — first registration, or the existing record is a different type (e.g. external), or the existing record has empty/zero fields — the agent MUST generate a new provider ID (REQ-SPR-091) and use the current time as `create_time` | MUST | Found via traceability audit: `resolveEmbeddedIdentity` implements this, but it had no governing requirement/AC — its 4 unit tests were mis-cited as UT-SPR-100–103, colliding with tests rightfully owned by AC-SPR-015 (REQ-SPR-030) and AC-SPR-111 (REQ-SPR-200) |
| REQ-SPR-220 | Successful embedded SP registration MUST be logged at INFO with `service_type`, `provider_id` | MUST | Today only the skip-due-to-conflict case logs; the success path was silent |
| REQ-SPR-221 | If an embedded SP registration succeeds in-memory but persisting it to disk fails while an existing persisted record for that service type remains intact, the agent MUST log a WARN (instead of the REQ-SPR-220 INFO) with `service_type`, `provider_id`, noting the persisted state is now stale, and MUST continue running rather than treating the write failure as fatal | MUST | Found via traceability audit: implemented (the stale-state WARN branch), but had no governing requirement — see `IT-SPR-194` |
| REQ-SPR-222 | When an embedded SP is removed because it is no longer enabled in configuration, successful removal MUST be logged at INFO with `service_type`, `provider_id`, `name`. If the underlying store delete fails, the agent MUST NOT log the success message and MUST instead log the failure at ERROR | MUST | Found via traceability audit: implemented in `removeStaleEmbedded`/`cleanupEmbeddedRecord`, but had no governing requirement — see `IT-SPR-195`, `IT-SPR-196` |

#### Requirements — External SP Registration

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-SPR-060 | The agent MUST expose `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` accepting a JSON body conforming to the Provider schema | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-070 | The Provider schema MUST require: `name`, `endpoint`, `service_type`, `schema_version`. The `display_name` field is OPTIONAL | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-075 | On re-registration (same `name`), if the `service_type` has changed, the agent MUST validate the new service type is not already occupied by another SP | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-076 | On re-registration with changed service type, if the new service type is occupied by another SP, the agent MUST reject with 409 Conflict | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-077 | On re-registration with changed service type, if the new service type is available, the agent MUST update the registration and free the old service type slot | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-080 | Registration MUST be idempotent using `name` as the natural key (create-or-update behavior) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-081 | `name` and `service_type` MUST be trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace before use as idempotency/collision keys, so whitespace-only differences cannot bypass REQ-SPR-080 or REQ-SPR-200 | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-090 | When a `?id=` query parameter is provided on provider registration, the agent MUST use it as the provider ID | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-091 | When the `?id=` query parameter is absent on provider registration, the agent MUST generate a provider ID using UUID v4 (lowercase hyphenated format). User-supplied `?id=` values MUST be validated against the AEP-122 pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$` (1–63 characters) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-100 | Successful new registration MUST return 201 Created with the full Provider resource including server-set fields (`id`, `path`, `create_time`, `update_time`) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-110 | Successful re-registration MUST return 200 OK with the updated Provider resource | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-120 | If the requested service type is already served by another SP (embedded or external, identified by a different name), the agent MUST reject the registration with 409 Conflict | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-121 | The 409 Conflict response MUST include an error message identifying the conflicting provider name and service type | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-130 | If the request body is malformed or fails validation, the agent MUST return 400 Bad Request with RFC 9457 error body | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-131 | If the request body passes structural parsing but fails semantic validation (`schema_version` pattern, `endpoint` not a valid URI, `?id=` pattern violation), the agent MUST return 422 Unprocessable Entity with RFC 9457 error body (type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-230 | Successful external SP registration (new registration, not update) MUST be logged at INFO with `service_type`, `provider_id`, `name` | MUST | Domain-level log distinct from the generic HTTP access-log status code |
| REQ-SPR-240 | External SP registration rejected due to a service-type slot conflict MUST be logged at WARN with `service_type`, `name`, and the conflict error (which identifies the existing slot holder) | MUST | Today only visible as HTTP `status=409` in the generic access log |
| REQ-SPR-241 | Successful external SP re-registration (an update to an existing record, not a new registration) MUST be logged at INFO with `service_type`, `provider_id`, `name` — distinct from REQ-SPR-230, which covers new registrations only. If persisting the update fails, the agent MUST NOT log this success message | MUST | Found via traceability audit: implemented, but had no governing requirement distinct from REQ-SPR-230 — see `IT-SPR-197`, `IT-SPR-198` |

#### Requirements — Persistence

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-SPR-170 | The agent MUST persist SP registrations to local storage so that slot ownership survives restarts | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-180 | On startup, the agent MUST load persisted registrations before registering embedded SPs or accepting external ones | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-190 | An external SP registered during a prior session MUST retain its service type slot across agent restarts | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-181 | If the persistence layer fails to load on startup (corruption, I/O error, schema mismatch), the agent MUST log the error and exit immediately (fail fast) | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-250 | On startup, `LoadPersisted` MUST log, at INFO, each restored provider's `name`, `service_type`, and type (embedded/external), plus a final summary count | MUST | |

> **Known limitation (v1alpha1):** When an external SP becomes Unavailable
> (via health monitoring), its registration is retained in local persistent
> storage and continues to block the service-type slot. No automatic slot
> reclamation exists in v1alpha1. Manual intervention (clearing the
> persistence store or restarting with a clean state) is required to reclaim
> the slot. A future version will define SP un-registration or automatic
> slot reclamation after prolonged Unavailability.

#### Requirements — Service Type Uniqueness

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-SPR-200 | Only one SP — embedded or external — may serve a given service type per agent | MUST | |
| REQ-SPR-210 | The first SP to register for a service type claims the slot | MUST | |

> **Note:** Because embedded SPs register at startup before external SPs can
> connect, they effectively take priority on a clean agent state. This is a
> consequence of REQ-SPR-030 and REQ-SPR-210, not a separate requirement.

#### Configuration Introduced

| Config Key | Env Var | Default | Min | Max | Unit | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| sp.embedded | AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS | (empty) | - | - | - | Comma-separated list of enabled embedded SP identifiers |

- **Given** the agent is configured with `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=container,cluster`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the embedded SPs for "container" and "cluster" service types MUST be registered internally
- **And** embedded registration MUST NOT make outbound REST calls

##### AC-SPR-015: Embedded SP initial health transition is not lost

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-030, REQ-HMN-100, REQ-HMN-120
- **Given** an embedded SP's initial health check (performed synchronously during registration)
  yields a status different from its initial assumed status (e.g. immediately Unhealthy)
- **When** the agent completes startup composition
- **Then** that transition MUST reach the same downstream handling as any later transition —
  retry-topic reprocessing and health CloudEvent publication — not be silently dropped because
  the transition callback was wired after embedded registration ran

##### AC-SPR-020: Embedded SPs not active by default

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-020
- **Given** `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS` is empty or not set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** no embedded SPs MUST be registered

##### AC-SPR-030: Embedded SP skipped when slot occupied

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-050, REQ-SPR-051
- **Given** a persisted external SP registration exists for service type "container"
- **And** the agent is configured with `AGENT_EMBEDDED_SPS=container`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the embedded SP registration for "container" MUST be skipped
- **And** a warning MUST be logged
- **And** the agent MUST continue starting normally

##### AC-SPR-052: Embedded SP identity preserved across restart

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-052
- **Given** a persisted embedded record already exists for a service type (from a prior session)
- **When** the embedded SP for that service type registers again
- **Then** the new registration MUST reuse the existing record's provider ID and `create_time`
- **Given** no persisted embedded record exists for the service type, or the persisted record for
  that service type belongs to a different (external) type, or an existing embedded record has an
  empty ID / zero `create_time`
- **When** the embedded SP registers
- **Then** the agent MUST generate a fresh provider ID and use the current time as `create_time`
- **And** this MUST hold end-to-end across a real agent restart (`resolveEmbeddedIdentity` alone
  proves the decision logic; identity stability must also survive the full `LoadPersisted` →
  `RegisterEmbedded` startup sequence, not just the helper function in isolation)

##### AC-SPR-220: Embedded SP registration success logged

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-220
- **Given** `registerEmbeddedType` completes without error
- **When** the embedded SP is registered
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `service_type`, `provider_id`

##### AC-SPR-221: Embedded SP registration with a stale persisted state logs WARN, not INFO

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-221
- **Given** an embedded SP already has a persisted record, and a subsequent registration attempt's
  persistence write (`Save`) fails
- **When** the registration otherwise completes (in-memory)
- **Then** a WARN log MUST be emitted noting the stale persisted state, with `service_type`, `provider_id`
- **And** the REQ-SPR-220 success INFO log MUST NOT also be emitted for that same attempt

##### AC-SPR-222: Embedded SP removal logged on success, suppressed on delete failure

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-222
- **Given** an embedded SP is no longer enabled in configuration and is removed
- **When** the store delete succeeds
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `service_type`, `provider_id`, `name`
- **Given** the store delete instead fails
- **When** removal is attempted
- **Then** the INFO success log MUST NOT be emitted, and an ERROR log MUST be emitted instead

##### AC-SPR-040: External SP registration — success (new)

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-060, REQ-SPR-100, REQ-SPR-230
- **Given** no SP is currently serving service type "database"

- **Then** the response MUST be 201 Created
- **And** the response body MUST include server-set fields: `id`, `path`, `create_time`, `update_time`

- **Given** a provider named "db-provider" is already registered for service type "database"
- **When** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is called with the same `name` and `service_type`
- **Then** the response MUST be 200 OK
- **And** the `update_time` MUST be refreshed

##### AC-SPR-051: External SP re-registration (update) success logged, suppressed on save failure

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-241
- **Given** an external SP re-registers with a changed field (e.g. `endpoint`)
- **When** the update is persisted successfully
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `service_type`, `provider_id`, `name`
- **Given** persisting that update instead fails
- **When** the re-registration is attempted
- **Then** the INFO success log MUST NOT be emitted

##### AC-SPR-060: Service type conflict

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-120, REQ-SPR-121, REQ-SPR-210, REQ-SPR-240
- **Given** an embedded SP is serving service type "container"
- **When** an external SP attempts to register for service type "container" with a different name
- **Then** the response MUST be 409 Conflict
- **And** the error message MUST identify the conflicting provider
- **And** a WARN log MUST be emitted with `service_type`, `name`, `error`

##### AC-SPR-070: Same SP re-registers for same service type (idempotent)

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-080
- **Given** "vm-provider" is registered for service type "vm"
- **When** "vm-provider" re-registers for service type "vm"
- **Then** the response MUST be 200 OK (idempotent update, not conflict)

##### AC-SPR-071: Whitespace-padded name/service_type does not bypass idempotency or slot collision

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-081
- **Given** "ws-provider" is registered for service type "ws-svc"
- **When** a registration is submitted with `name="  ws-provider  "` (leading/trailing whitespace)
  and the same `service_type`
- **Then** the response MUST be 200 OK, treated as an idempotent update of the SAME provider — not
  a new registration
- **And** symmetrically, a whitespace-padded `service_type` matching an already-claimed slot MUST
  still be rejected with 409 Conflict

##### AC-SPR-090: Persistence across restart

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-170, REQ-SPR-180, REQ-SPR-190
- **Given** an external SP "db-provider" is registered for service type "database"
- **When** the agent restarts
- **Then** "db-provider" MUST still hold the "database" service type slot
- **And** the agent MUST load the persisted registration before processing new registrations

##### AC-SPR-250: Persisted providers restored with identity logged

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-250
- **Given** `LoadPersisted` runs at startup with one or more persisted providers
- **When** each persisted provider is successfully restored
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `name`, `service_type`, `type`
- **And** a final INFO summary log MUST be emitted with restored/conflict counts

##### AC-SPR-092: Persisted writes are fsync'd before and after rename

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-170
- **Given** a provider registration is being persisted (`FileStore.Save`/`Delete`)
- **When** the write completes
- **Then** the temp file's contents MUST be fsync'd before the atomic rename into place
- **And** the parent directory MUST be fsync'd after the rename, so the directory-entry update
  itself survives a crash immediately following the write
- **And** a failure to fsync the temp file MUST abort before the rename (the previous persisted
  state remains intact, no partial/torn write is exposed)
- **And** a failure to fsync the parent directory AFTER the rename has already succeeded MUST NOT
  be reported as a `Save`/`Delete` failure — the rename already made the new data durable and
  visible to readers; treating this as a failure would make `service.ProviderService` roll back
  in-memory registry/health state to the pre-write state while the disk still reflects the
  post-write state, desyncing the two (see AC-SPR-111's slot-ownership invariant)

##### AC-SPR-095: Re-registration with changed service type (available)

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-075, REQ-SPR-077

- **And** "db-provider" MUST now serve "analytics"
- **And** the "database" slot MUST be freed

##### AC-SPR-096: Re-registration with changed service type (conflict)

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-075, REQ-SPR-076
- **Given** "db-provider" is registered for service type "database"
- **And** another SP "other-provider" is serving service type "analytics"

- **Then** the response MUST be 409 Conflict

##### AC-SPR-100: Invalid registration body

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-130
- **Given** a POST request with missing required fields (e.g., no `service_type`)

- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** the response MUST be 400 Bad Request

##### AC-SPR-108: Semantic validation returns 422

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-131
- **Given** `POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` with a valid JSON body where `schema_version` does not match the pattern `^v[0-9]+(alpha|beta)?[0-9]*$`
- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** the response MUST be 422 Unprocessable Entity with RFC 9457 error body (type=https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity)

##### AC-SPR-108b: Endpoint URI semantic validation returns 422

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-200
- **Given** an SP is registered for service type "database"
- **When** a different SP attempts to register for service type "database"
- **Then** the registration MUST be rejected with 409 Conflict

##### AC-SPR-111: Slot mutations verify current ownership before releasing a service type

- **Validates:** REQ-SPR-200
- **Given** the registry's in-memory slot map and the persisted store have desynced (e.g. a stale
  embedded record survives after an external provider has since claimed that service type)
- **When** any operation that releases or moves a service-type slot runs (a provider changing its

### 4.4 Provider Query Endpoints

#### Overview

The agent exposes two endpoints for querying Service Provider state:

- `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` — lists all registered SPs (both embedded and
  external) with their current health status.
- `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers/{provider_id}` — returns a single SP by ID with
  its current health status.

Health state fields (`type`, `status`, `last_check_time`) are read-only properties on
the Provider resource itself, eliminating the need for a separate status schema.

These endpoints are always available regardless of deployment mode (Kubernetes,
Docker, standalone).

Out of scope: Historical status data, metrics.

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-STS-010 | The agent MUST expose `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` returning all registered SPs with their current health state | MUST | |

| REQ-STS-020 | The agent MUST expose `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers/{provider_id}` returning a single SP by ID | MUST | |
| REQ-STS-025 | If the requested `provider_id` does not match any registered SP, the agent MUST return 404 Not Found with RFC 9457 error body | MUST | |
| REQ-STS-030 | Each Provider resource MUST include read-only health fields: `type` (embedded/external), `status` (Ready/Unhealthy/Unavailable), `last_check_time` timestamp | MUST | |
| REQ-STS-040 | The list endpoint MUST include all registered SPs regardless of their health state | MUST | |

---

### 4.5 SP Health Monitoring

#### Terminology

Three distinct health-related concepts are used throughout this spec:

- **Agent process health**: Whether the agent itself is operational (HTTP server
  accepting connections AND messaging system connected). Used by `GET /health`
  and Kubernetes liveness probes. See §4.2.
- **SP runtime state**: The three-state model (Ready / Unhealthy / Unavailable)
  per registered SP. See requirements below.
- **DCM-advertisable**: A service type is advertisable when backed by an SP in
  Ready or Unhealthy state (i.e., not Unavailable). This is what "healthy" means
  in the DCM registration context (§4.6).

#### Overview

The agent monitors the health of its registered Service Providers using the
three-state health model (Ready, Unhealthy, Unavailable). The monitoring
mechanism differs by SP type: in-process for embedded SPs, endpoint polling for
external SPs.

The agent differentiates behavior based on health state: Unhealthy SPs keep their
service type advertised but stop receiving requests; Unavailable SPs cause service
type removal from DCM.

On Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments, the agent additionally surfaces SP health as
custom pod conditions.

Out of scope: Metrics/observability integration.

#### Requirements — Health Check Mechanism

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-HMN-010 | The agent MUST periodically check the health of each registered external SP by polling its `GET /health` endpoint | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-020 | The agent MUST check the health of each registered embedded SP in-process without a network call | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-030 | The health check interval MUST be configurable | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-040 | The health check MUST have a configurable timeout per SP call | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Three-State Model

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-HMN-050 | SP responding with `200 OK` and `status: "healthy"` (external) or internal check passing (embedded) MUST set state to Ready | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-051 | Newly registered external SPs MUST receive an immediate health check. The resulting state MUST reflect the check outcome: Ready if healthy, Unhealthy otherwise. On agent restart, previously persisted external SPs MAY defer their first check to the next periodic tick | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-052 | Newly registered embedded SPs MUST have their in-process health check executed immediately. The initial state is set based on the result: Ready if passing, Unhealthy if reporting unhealthy | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-054 | When an external SP re-registers with a changed endpoint, its health state MUST reset to Unhealthy and an immediate health check MUST be performed. Non-endpoint field changes MUST NOT affect health state | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-060 | SP responding with `200 OK` and `status: "unhealthy"` (external) or internal check reporting unhealthy (embedded) MUST set state to Unhealthy | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-070 | SP not responding (connection refused, DNS failure, TCP timeout, HTTP status other than 200, or response body unparseable) after exceeding a configurable failure threshold MUST set state to Unavailable | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-080 | A healthy response MUST reset the failure counter for the SP | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-090 | An unhealthy response MUST NOT increment the failure counter (the SP is reachable but not fully operational) | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Behavior on State Transitions

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-HMN-100 | When an SP becomes Unhealthy, the agent MUST keep the service type in its advertised list to DCM | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-110 | When an SP becomes Unhealthy, the agent MUST stop routing new requests to that SP | MUST | Requests are queued to the retry topic; see REQ-RTE-090 |
| REQ-HMN-120 | When an SP becomes Unhealthy, the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.health.service-type-degraded` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.health` | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-130 | When an SP becomes Unavailable, the agent MUST remove the service type from its advertised list | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-140 | When an SP becomes Unavailable, the agent MUST send a `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` to DCM with the updated registration (service types without the affected type) | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-145 | When an SP becomes Unavailable, the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.health.service-type-unavailable` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.health` | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-150 | When an SP becomes Unavailable, the agent MUST process the retry topic and reject all held requests for that service type with error CloudEvents | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-170 | When a previously unhealthy or unavailable SP recovers to Ready, the agent MUST process held requests from the retry topic for that service type | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-180 | When an SP recovers from Unavailable to Ready, the agent MUST re-add the service type to its list and send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` to DCM with the updated registration | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-185 | When an SP transitions from Unavailable to Unhealthy, the agent MUST re-add the service type to its advertised list and send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` to DCM with the updated registration. The retry topic MUST NOT be processed on this transition (only on transition to Ready per REQ-HMN-170) | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Pod Conditions (Kubernetes/OpenShift)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-HMN-190 | On Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments, the agent SHOULD surface SP health as custom pod conditions on its own pod | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-200 | Each registered SP SHOULD be represented as a separate pod condition using the SP's provider ID and service type as the condition type | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-210 | The condition `status` SHOULD be `True` for Ready SPs and `False` for Unhealthy/Unavailable SPs | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-220 | The condition `reason` SHOULD reflect the health state (Ready, Unhealthy, Unavailable) | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-230 | The condition `message` SHOULD include the SP name, service type, and current health state string (e.g., 'SP db-provider (database): Unhealthy') | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-240 | The agent SHOULD use Pod Readiness Gates to surface per-SP health as custom pod conditions | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-250 | Pod condition updates SHOULD use in-cluster authentication to patch the pod's `status.conditions` | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-260 | Pod conditions SHOULD be updated only when a health state changes, not on every health check | SHOULD | |
| REQ-HMN-270 | If the agent cannot update pod conditions (e.g., running outside K8s, missing RBAC), it MUST log a warning and continue all other operations (SP health monitoring, DCM heartbeats, request routing) without interruption | MUST | |
| REQ-HMN-280 | Each individual SP health-check result MUST be logged at DEBUG with `provider_id`, `service_type` (where available), outcome, and check duration | MUST | High-frequency by design (fires every check interval per provider) — DEBUG, not INFO |
| REQ-HMN-290 | When a new provider is added to health monitoring (`RegisterProvider`) it MUST be logged at INFO; a state transition detected during the initial check MUST be logged with the same WARN fields a periodic-check transition uses | MUST | Fixes an asymmetry where `RegisterProvider`'s initial check silently skipped the transition log periodic checks emit |

#### Configuration Introduced

| Config Key | Env Var | Default | Min | Max | Unit | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| health.checkInterval | AGENT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL | 10s | 1s | 5m | duration | Interval between health checks for external SPs |
| health.checkTimeout | AGENT_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT | 5s | 500ms | health.checkInterval | duration | Timeout per health check call |
| health.failureThreshold | AGENT_HEALTH_FAILURE_THRESHOLD | 3 | 1 | 100 | integer | Consecutive failures before marking SP as Unavailable |
| health.podConditionsEnabled | AGENT_POD_CONDITIONS_ENABLED | auto | - | - | - | Parsed and validated (`auto`/`true`/`false`) but never read past config loading — pod-condition updates are unimplemented in v1alpha1. See DD-270 |

### 4.6 DCM Registration & Heartbeat

#### Overview

The agent self-registers with the DCM Control Plane once at least one SP is
registered and not Unavailable (see Terminology in §4.5). Registration is
idempotent (name as natural key). After registration, the agent sends periodic
heartbeats including consumer lag.

Out of scope: Agent de-registration on shutdown, HA coordination.

#### Requirements — Agent Registration

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-DCM-010 | The agent MUST register with DCM via `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` once at least one SP (embedded or external) is registered and not Unavailable | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-020 | The registration payload MUST include: `name`, `environment`, `service_types`, `cost`, `topic_name`. The `topic_name` value MUST be the prefixed main subject (`dcm.agent.{base}` per REQ-MSG-010). The initial registration MUST include a non-empty `service_types` list. Subsequent updates MAY include an empty list (see REQ-DCM-115) | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-030 | The registration payload SHOULD include `resources_available` when available. Structure: `{total_cpu: string, total_memory: string (e.g., "1TB"), total_storage: string (e.g., "2TB"), total_node: integer}` — sourced from K8s node info or manual configuration | SHOULD | Aligned with OpenAPI `ResourceCapacity` schema (snake_case) |
| REQ-DCM-040 | Registration MUST execute asynchronously without blocking HTTP server startup | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-050 | Registration MUST retry with exponential backoff using formula: min(initialInterval × 2^attempt, maxInterval) with full jitter (uniform random in [0, calculated]) on failure | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-060 | Non-retryable errors (4xx client errors except 429 Too Many Requests) MUST stop retries immediately. On 429, the agent MUST respect the `Retry-After` header if present, or apply standard backoff | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-070 | Registration failures MUST be logged without causing the agent to exit | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-080 | Re-registration on restart MUST update the existing agent entry in DCM using `name` as the natural key (idempotent behavior) | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-090 | After successful registration, the agent MUST store the returned `agent_id` exclusively in memory for use in heartbeats and updates. The `agent_id` is assigned by DCM in the registration response; on restart the agent relies on DCM's idempotent registration to recover it | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-100 | The agent MUST wait until at least one SP is registered and not Unavailable before registering to DCM (prerequisite gate) | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-110 | Each service type advertised to DCM MUST be backed by an SP in Ready or Unhealthy state (not Unavailable) | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-115 | When all SPs become Unavailable after initial registration, the agent MUST send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` with an empty `service_types` list | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Service Type Change Notification

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-DCM-120 | When the list of supported service types changes (SP registration or health-driven removal) and the agent is already registered to DCM, the agent MUST send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` with the full updated registration payload | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-121 | Re-registration triggered by a service-type change (REQ-DCM-120) MUST be retried on failure using the same backoff policy and non-retryable error handling as initial registration (REQ-DCM-050, REQ-DCM-060). The agent ID MUST only be updated once the retry succeeds, and no additional service-type-change notification is required for the retry to eventually succeed | MUST | Closes a gap where a transient failure (e.g. an auth token endpoint outage) during re-registration was logged once and the notification silently dropped, leaving DCM with stale advertised capabilities indefinitely |
| REQ-DCM-122 | Each individual registration attempt (initial or re-registration, per REQ-DCM-121's shared retry loop) MUST be bounded by a configurable per-attempt request timeout, applied identically regardless of which triggered the attempt | MUST | A DCM connection that is accepted but never answered would otherwise block the single registrar event loop for the underlying HTTP client's full timeout on every attempt before backoff even starts. The timeout MUST be identical for both call sites — REQ-DCM-121 requires initial and re-registration attempts to behave the same way, so this cannot be a re-registration-only fix |
| REQ-DCM-130 | If the agent is not yet registered to DCM when the service type list changes, the agent MUST defer — the SP registration satisfies the prerequisite for initial DCM registration | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Heartbeat

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-DCM-140 | After successful registration, the agent MUST send periodic heartbeats to DCM via `PUT /api/v1alpha1/agents/{agentId}/heartbeat` | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-150 | The heartbeat payload MUST include `timestamp` (ISO 8601) and `consumer_lag`: the total count of messages on the main topic's durable consumer that have not yet been acknowledged, counting both messages still queued for delivery to that consumer and messages already delivered to it but not yet acknowledged — excluding the retry and cancel topics entirely. `timestamp` MUST be strictly greater than the previous heartbeat's `timestamp` | MUST | Generated fresh via `time.Now()` on every send; DCM rejects a heartbeat whose timestamp isn't strictly increasing |
| REQ-DCM-160 | The heartbeat interval MUST be configurable | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-170 | Heartbeat failures MUST be logged and retried on the next interval without causing the agent to exit | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-180 | DCM registrar startup MUST be logged at INFO. Successful heartbeats MUST be logged at DEBUG with `agent_id`, `consumer_lag`. Successful re-registration MUST be logged at INFO with `agent_id` | MUST | Today only failures/retries are logged on these three paths; success was silent |

##### Requirements — Outbound Authentication

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-DCM-190 | The agent MAY be configured with authentication for outbound HTTP requests to the control plane. When configured, all registration and heartbeat requests MUST include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header | MAY/MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-200 | The agent MUST support a static token mode. When `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, the agent MUST use its value as the bearer token for all outbound CP requests | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-210 | The agent MUST support an OAuth2 client-credentials mode. When `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`, `DCM_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and `DCM_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are all configured, the agent MUST use `grant_type=client_credentials` to obtain access tokens from the token endpoint | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-220 | In client-credentials mode, the agent MUST cache the access token and refresh it proactively before expiry (using the `expires_in` field from the token response, with a safety buffer). Token fetch failures MUST NOT crash the agent; the failed request is retried by existing backoff logic | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-221 | The agent MUST reject a token response whose `expires_in` is missing, zero, or negative, treating it as a fetch failure (REQ-DCM-220) rather than caching a token with an unpredictable expiry. An arbitrarily large `expires_in` MUST NOT be rejected as an overflow error; it is clamped to `math.MaxInt32` seconds (~68 years) by the underlying OAuth2 library and cached with that clamped expiry | MUST | A zero/negative `expires_in` would defeat caching entirely (every call re-fetches). The library's wire-format decoder parses `expires_in` as an `int32` and clamps any larger value down to `math.MaxInt32` rather than erroring, so it structurally cannot overflow `time.Duration`'s underlying `int64` nanoseconds at that scale |
| REQ-DCM-230 | Client-credentials mode MUST take precedence over static-token mode if both are configured | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-240 | If neither `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` nor client-credentials config is present, the agent MUST send requests without an `Authorization` header (backward-compatible default) | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-250 | When client-credentials mode is partially configured (e.g., token endpoint set but client ID missing), the agent MUST fail fast at startup with an error identifying the missing fields | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-251 | When client-credentials mode is fully configured, the agent MUST also validate that `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` is an absolute URL with a nonempty host and an `http`/`https` scheme, failing fast at startup otherwise | MUST | A fully-populated but malformed/relative/hostless/unsupported-scheme endpoint would otherwise pass startup validation and fail only at request time, on every registration attempt, indistinguishable from a transient outage |
| REQ-DCM-260 | When client-credentials mode is configured and `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` uses the `http` scheme, the agent MUST log a warning at startup that the client secret will be sent unencrypted | MUST | |
| REQ-DCM-261 | The agent's client-credentials token-fetch HTTP client MUST NOT follow HTTP redirects returned by the token endpoint; a redirect response MUST be treated as a token fetch failure (REQ-DCM-220) | MUST | The token request body carries `client_id`/`client_secret`; Go's default `http.Client` resends the same method and body to a 307/308 `Location`, including cross-origin, which would resend the client secret to an unintended destination |

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-010, REQ-DCM-100, REQ-DCM-090
- **Given** the agent starts with one embedded SP configured and not Unavailable
- **When** the SP becomes Ready
- **Then** the agent MUST send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` to DCM with the correct payload
- **And** the agent MUST store the returned `agent_id` in memory

##### AC-DCM-020: Registration waits for non-Unavailable SP

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-100
- **Given** the agent starts with no SPs configured
- **When** no SP is registered and not Unavailable
- **Then** the agent MUST NOT send a registration request to DCM

##### AC-DCM-030: Registration payload correctness

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-020
- **Given** the agent is configured with `name="agent-prod-1"`, `environment="production"`, `cost="medium"`, `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME="agent-prod-1"`
- **And** service types ["container", "database"] are available
- **When** the agent registers to DCM
- **Then** the payload MUST include all required fields with correct values (including `topic_name="dcm.agent.agent-prod-1"` and `service_types=["container","database"]`)

##### AC-DCM-040: Idempotent re-registration on restart

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-080
- **Given** the agent was previously registered to DCM with name "agent-prod-1"
- **When** the agent restarts and re-registers with the same name
- **Then** DCM MUST update the existing entry (not create a duplicate)
- **And** the agent MUST receive the same `agent_id`

##### AC-DCM-050: Registration retry with exponential backoff

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-050, REQ-DCM-070
- **Given** the DCM Control Plane is unreachable
- **When** a registration attempt fails
- **Then** the agent MUST retry with exponential backoff
- **And** MUST continue serving HTTP requests

##### AC-DCM-060: Non-retryable error stops retries

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-060
- **Given** DCM returns a 4xx status code other than 429
- **When** the agent receives this response
- **Then** retries MUST stop immediately
- **And** the error MUST be logged at ERROR level

##### AC-DCM-061: 429 Too Many Requests respects Retry-After

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-060
- **Given** DCM returns HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header
- **When** the agent receives this response
- **Then** the agent MUST wait at least the duration specified by `Retry-After` before the next attempt
- **And** if no `Retry-After` header is present, the agent MUST apply standard exponential backoff

##### AC-DCM-055: Registrar goroutine panic does not crash the agent, and registration keeps making forward progress

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-070
- **Given** a dependency injected into the registrar (e.g. `ServiceTypeLister`) panics, whether once
  or repeatedly
- **When** the registrar's background goroutine invokes that dependency
- **Then** each panic MUST be recovered and logged
- **And** the agent process MUST continue running (HTTP server, routing, other background
  goroutines unaffected)
- **And** the registrar goroutine itself MUST NOT permanently exit after a recovered panic —
  registration/heartbeating MUST keep being retried afterward, so DCM registration does not
  silently stall forever for the remainder of the process lifetime just because one dependency
  call panicked once
- **And** the "DCM registrar starting" log line emitted by the restarted goroutine MUST carry a
  `restart_attempt` attribute (absent on the initial, pre-panic startup log), so operators can
  distinguish a post-panic restart from a fresh start in the logs

##### AC-DCM-070: Service type change triggers DCM update

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-120
- **Given** the agent is registered to DCM with service types ["container"]
- **And** an external SP registers for service type "database"
- **When** the service type list changes to ["container", "database"]
- **Then** the agent MUST send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` with the updated list

##### AC-DCM-071: Re-registration retries transient failures until success

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-121
- **Given** the agent is registered to DCM and a service-type change triggers re-registration
- **And** the re-registration request fails with a retryable error (e.g. a transient auth token
  acquisition failure)
- **When** the underlying failure clears
- **Then** the agent MUST retry the same re-registration using the registration backoff policy
  (REQ-DCM-050), without requiring another service-type-change notification
- **And** the agent ID MUST only be updated once the retried re-registration succeeds

##### AC-DCM-072: Per-attempt request timeout applies identically to initial and re-registration

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-122
- **Given** DCM accepts a registration or re-registration connection but never responds
- **When** the configured per-attempt request timeout (`DCM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`) elapses
- **Then** the in-flight attempt MUST fail and be retried through the existing backoff policy
  (REQ-DCM-050), rather than blocking the registrar's single event loop for the underlying HTTP
  client's full timeout
- **And** this bound MUST apply the same way whether the attempt is the initial registration or a
  re-registration retry (REQ-DCM-121) — never a tighter bound on one and a looser bound on the
  other

##### AC-DCM-080: Periodic heartbeat

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-140, REQ-DCM-150
- **Given** the agent is registered and its DCM-assigned agent ID is `"agent-123"`
- **When** the heartbeat interval elapses

##### AC-DCM-090: Heartbeat includes consumer lag

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-150

- **When** a heartbeat is sent
- **Then** `consumer_lag` MUST be 5

##### AC-DCM-091: Heartbeat timestamps strictly increase

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-150
- **Given** the registrar sends multiple heartbeats over time
- **When** the payload `timestamp` of each is compared to the previous one
- **Then** each MUST be strictly greater than the previous (`IT-DCM-135`)

##### AC-DCM-100: All SPs unavailable — empty service_types sent to DCM

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-115
- **Given** the agent is registered to DCM with service types ["container", "database"]
- **And** both SPs become Unavailable
- **When** the last SP transitions to Unavailable
- **Then** the agent MUST send `POST /api/v1alpha1/agents` with `service_types=[]`
- **And** the agent MUST remain registered (not de-register)

##### AC-DCM-015: Registration non-blocking to HTTP

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-040
- **Given** DCM is unreachable
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the HTTP server MUST be listening before DCM registration completes

##### AC-DCM-025: Pre-registration defers changes

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-130
- **Given** the agent is not yet registered to DCM
- **When** an SP registers and changes the service type list

- **When** the next interval elapses
- **Then** the agent MUST retry the heartbeat
- **And** MUST NOT exit due to heartbeat failure

##### AC-DCM-105: Advertised service types backed by non-Unavailable SPs

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-110
- **Given** the agent has SPs in Ready, Unhealthy, and Unavailable states
- **When** the agent sends a registration or update to DCM
- **Then** `service_types` MUST include only types backed by SPs in Ready or Unhealthy state
- **And** MUST NOT include types whose SP is Unavailable

##### AC-DCM-180: Registrar start/stop, heartbeat success, re-registration success logged

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-180
- **Given** the registrar starts
- **When** its goroutine begins running
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted
- **Given** a heartbeat succeeds
- **When** it completes
- **Then** a DEBUG log MUST be emitted with `agent_id`, `consumer_lag`

##### AC-DCM-195: Token attached to heartbeat request

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-190
- **Given** auth is configured (static token or client credentials)
- **When** the agent sends a heartbeat request to DCM
- **Then** the request MUST include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

##### AC-DCM-200: Static token used when no client-credentials config

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-200
- **Given** `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and no client-credentials env vars are configured
- **When** the agent sends any outbound CP request
- **Then** the `Authorization` header value MUST be `Bearer <DCM_AUTH_TOKEN>`

##### AC-DCM-210: Client-credentials mode fetches token from endpoint

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-210
- **Given** `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`, `DCM_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and `DCM_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are all set
- **When** the agent needs a token for an outbound CP request
- **Then** it MUST POST `grant_type=client_credentials` to the token endpoint and use the returned `access_token`

##### AC-DCM-215: Client-credentials cached token reused until near expiry

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-220
- **Given** a token was previously fetched via client credentials
- **When** the token is still valid (not near expiry)
- **Then** subsequent `Token()` calls MUST return the cached token without hitting the endpoint

##### AC-DCM-220: Client-credentials token refreshed before expiry

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-220
- **Given** a cached token is near expiry (within safety buffer)
- **When** `Token()` is called
- **Then** a new token MUST be fetched from the endpoint

##### AC-DCM-225: Client-credentials token fetch failure does not crash agent

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-220
- **Given** client-credentials mode is configured
- **When** the token endpoint is unreachable or returns an error
- **Then** the error MUST be propagated to the caller (register/heartbeat), not crash the agent

##### AC-DCM-226: Malformed `expires_in` is rejected, not cached; oversized `expires_in` is clamped

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-221
- **Given** client-credentials mode is configured
- **When** the token endpoint returns a response with `expires_in` missing, zero, or negative
- **Then** `Token()` MUST return an error (propagated like any other fetch failure, per
  REQ-DCM-220) instead of caching a token with an unpredictable expiry
- **Given** client-credentials mode is configured
- **When** the token endpoint returns a response with `expires_in` larger than `math.MaxInt32`
- **Then** `Token()` MUST succeed, caching the token with its expiry clamped to `math.MaxInt32`
  seconds from now (~68 years) rather than returning an overflow error

##### AC-DCM-230: Client-credentials takes precedence over static token

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-230
- **Given** both `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` and client-credentials env vars are configured
- **When** the agent resolves its auth mode at startup
- **Then** client-credentials mode MUST be used (static token is ignored)

##### AC-DCM-235: No auth configured sends no Authorization header

- **Validates:** REQ-DCM-240
- **Given** neither `DCM_AUTH_TOKEN` nor client-credentials env vars are set

### 4.7 Messaging System Integration

#### Overview

The agent uses **NATS with JetStream** as its messaging system for communication
with DCM. This is consistent with other DCM components (e.g., the Control Plane).

At startup the agent derives three **subjects** from a deterministic **base name**
(`AGENT_TOPIC_NAME` if set, otherwise `AGENT_NAME`):

| Subject role | NATS subject | Stream ownership |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Main (create/delete requests from CP) | `dcm.agent.{base}` | Control-plane stream `dcm-agent-requests` (wildcard `dcm.agent.>`) |
| Cancel (cancel requests from CP) | `dcm.agent.{base}.cancel` | Same CP stream |
| Retry (agent-internal hold queue) | `{base}.retry` | Agent-owned stream `{base}-retry` |

The control plane owns JetStream streams for all CP-facing subjects (`dcm-agent-requests`
binding `dcm.agent.>`, and `dcm-agent-responses` binding `dcm.agents.responses`).
The agent MUST NOT create competing streams on those subjects. It creates **durable
consumers** filtered to its own main and cancel subjects on `dcm-agent-requests`,
and **publishes** response CloudEvents directly to `dcm.agents.responses` (no
response stream creation). The agent still creates and owns its internal retry
stream and a health stream for `dcm.agents.health`.

The prefixed main subject (`dcm.agent.{base}`) is advertised to DCM as `topic_name`
during registration. The unprefixed retry subject is never CP-facing.

> **Terminology mapping:** This spec uses "topic" as a logical abstraction.
> In NATS JetStream terms: a *topic* maps to a JetStream **subject**. CP-facing
> subjects share the control-plane-owned `dcm-agent-requests` stream; the agent
> consumes via durable **consumers** with `FilterSubject`. Agent-internal retry
> uses a dedicated agent-owned stream.

Out of scope: Creating or administering control-plane JetStream streams. The agent
MUST tolerate the CP not having created `dcm-agent-requests` yet at startup (see
REQ-MSG-051).

#### Requirements — Topic Management

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-MSG-010 | The agent MUST derive a deterministic **base name** at startup: the value of `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME` if set, otherwise `AGENT_NAME`. The base name MUST conform to NATS subject token rules (alphanumeric, hyphens, dots, underscores; no spaces or wildcards; max 255 characters) and MUST NOT already start with the reserved `dcm.agent.` prefix. The control-plane-facing **main subject** MUST be `dcm.agent.{base}` | MUST | Prefix `dcm.agent.` is a static constant, not user input; rejecting a pre-prefixed base avoids double-prefixing and prevents the agent-owned retry subject from landing inside the CP's `dcm.agent.>` wildcard. See REQ-MSG-011 for the stricter constraints that additionally apply to JetStream stream/consumer name derivation |
| REQ-MSG-011 | In addition to REQ-MSG-010, the base name MUST NOT contain dots (`.`), and MUST be short enough that appending the longest JetStream stream/consumer name suffix (`-cancel-consumer`, REQ-MSG-020/047) does not exceed 255 characters. Both constraints are stricter than REQ-MSG-010's own subject-token rules — dots and up to 255 characters are valid for NATS *subject* tokens, but the base name is also used to derive JetStream *stream and durable-consumer* names, where the NATS client rejects dots and the NATS server rejects names over 255 characters. The agent MUST validate both constraints at startup and fail fast with a clear error, rather than retrying stream/consumer creation indefinitely per REQ-MSG-051 without ever succeeding | MUST | Dot case discovered via review: a dotted base passes REQ-MSG-010's own check but breaks stream/consumer name derivation client-side (`nats.go`'s `validateStreamName`/`validateConsumerName`). Length case discovered via a follow-up review round: a base up to 255 chars also passes REQ-MSG-010's own check but can still overflow the server-side `JSMaxNameLen` (255) once a suffix is appended. Both would otherwise only surface as an unbounded retry loop at startup |
| REQ-MSG-020 | The agent MUST create an agent-owned retry stream at startup backing subject `{base}.retry` (stream name `{base}-retry`) | MUST | Never published to by the control plane |
| REQ-MSG-030 | The agent MUST derive the control-plane-facing **cancel subject** as `dcm.agent.{base}.cancel` | MUST | Part of the `dcm.agent.>` wildcard; consumed via durable consumer on `dcm-agent-requests`, not an agent-owned stream |
| REQ-MSG-040 | If agent-owned streams or CP-stream durable consumers already exist, the agent MUST reuse them (`CreateOrUpdateStream` / `CreateOrUpdateConsumer`) | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-045 | The agent MUST create durable JetStream consumers on first startup | MUST | Main and cancel on `dcm-agent-requests`; retry on agent-owned retry stream |
| REQ-MSG-046 | The agent MUST reuse (bind to) existing JetStream consumers on subsequent startups | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-047 | JetStream consumer names MUST be deterministic (derived from the base name: `{base}-consumer`, `{base}-cancel-consumer`, `{base}-retry-consumer`) to ensure resumption from the last acknowledged message position | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-048 | The agent MUST NOT create JetStream streams for control-plane-owned subjects (`dcm.agent.>` or `dcm.agents.responses`) | MUST | CP owns `dcm-agent-requests` and `dcm-agent-responses`; overlapping bindings are rejected by NATS |
| REQ-MSG-049 | The agent MUST create durable consumers on the control-plane stream `dcm-agent-requests` with `FilterSubject` set to its main subject (`dcm.agent.{base}`) and cancel subject (`dcm.agent.{base}.cancel`) respectively | MUST | One consumer per subject; both bound to the same CP stream |
| REQ-MSG-050 | Only the prefixed main subject (`dcm.agent.{base}`) is advertised to DCM as `topic_name` during registration. The retry subject is agent-internal. DCM publishes cancel requests to `dcm.agent.{base}.cancel` | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-051 | When creating durable consumers on `dcm-agent-requests`, if the stream does not exist yet (control plane not started), the agent MUST retry indefinitely in two phases: (1) an initial bounded attempt retrying every 2s for up to 30s, synchronous with agent startup; (2) if phase 1 fails, a background retry of the full setup attempt every 30s, indefinitely, until it succeeds or the agent shuts down. The agent MUST NOT permanently give up while running | MUST | The CP may take longer than 30s to create its stream (e.g. rolling restarts); giving up permanently would leave the agent silently consuming nothing. Logs WARN for the expected "stream not found" case, ERROR for any other consumer-creation failure (both still retried) |

#### Requirements — Message Consumption

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-MSG-060 | The agent MUST maintain an active JetStream consumer subscription on the main topic, processing messages as they arrive | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-070 | The agent MUST maintain an active JetStream consumer subscription on the cancel topic to keep the deny list current | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-080 | The agent MUST use durable JetStream consumers for the main, retry, and cancel topics to ensure no messages are lost across agent restarts | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-090 | On startup, the agent MUST drain the cancel topic (consuming messages until the consumer reports no pending messages or a configurable drain timeout of 5s elapses) to populate the deny list before processing main and retry topics | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-100 | The agent MUST handle messaging system connection failures: log at WARN level, reconnect with exponential backoff (same formula as REQ-DCM-050), and continue operating. Messaging unavailability MUST NOT crash the agent | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-110 | Messaging system availability MUST NOT block agent HTTP server startup | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-115 | The agent MUST acknowledge a message only after the routing outcome is finalized — the request has been forwarded to the SP and the SP's HTTP response received, the message has been published to the retry topic, or the message has been resolved without forwarding (error CloudEvent published or deny list drop). For the main-topic consume path, `MaxDeliver`-exceeded handling and per-message handler-timeout enforcement MUST occur in the messaging client before invoking the router handler (see REQ-RCM-160, REQ-RCM-180) | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-116 | Unacknowledged messages MUST be redelivered by JetStream on reconnection | MUST | |

#### Requirements — CloudEvent Format

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-MSG-120 | See REQ-XC-CE-010. All messages exchanged through the messaging system MUST conform to CloudEvents v1.0 | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-130 | All agent-originated CloudEvents MUST include `agent_name` and `topic_name` in the data payload for correlation (`topic_name` is the prefixed main subject, e.g. `dcm.agent.{base}`) | MUST | AEP snake_case wire format |
| REQ-MSG-135 | Agent response and health CloudEvents MUST be published via JetStream with a `Nats-Msg-Id` header set to the CloudEvent's own `id`, enabling server-side deduplication if publish is retried | MUST | See REQ-XC-CE-050 |
| REQ-MSG-140 | Agent response CloudEvents MUST be published to the `dcm.agents.responses` subject without creating a response stream (JetStream routes to the CP-owned `dcm-agent-responses` stream) | MUST | |
| REQ-MSG-150 | Agent health warning CloudEvents MUST be published to the `dcm.agents.health` subject | MUST | Agent creates `dcm-health` stream for this subject |

#### Requirements — Message Lifecycle Logging

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-MSG-160 | The agent MUST log at INFO when a message is received on the main or cancel subject, including `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `subject`, `stream_seq`, `consumer_seq`, `num_delivered` | MUST | Enables reconstructing receipt of a request from logs alone |
| REQ-MSG-170 | The agent MUST log the terminal resolution of every consumed message: INFO on successful Ack, WARN on Nak-with-redelivery, including `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `subject` | MUST | Today only Ack/Nak *failures* are logged; the outcome itself was silent |
| REQ-MSG-180 | The agent MUST log at INFO when messaging setup completes and live consumption begins, and when the messaging client finishes shutting down | MUST | |

#### Configuration Introduced

| Config Key | Env Var | Default | Min | Max | Unit | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| messaging.url | AGENT_MESSAGING_URL | (required) | - | - | - | Messaging system URL |
| messaging.topicName | AGENT_TOPIC_NAME | (derived from AGENT_NAME) | - | - | - | Unprefixed base name; main subject is `dcm.agent.{base}` |
| messaging.ackWait | AGENT_MESSAGING_ACK_WAIT | 120s | 10s | 5m | duration | Main-topic durable consumer AckWait |
| messaging.cancelAckWait | AGENT_MESSAGING_CANCEL_ACK_WAIT | 10s | 1s | 1m | duration | Cancel-topic durable consumer AckWait |
| messaging.reconnectInitialBackoff | AGENT_MESSAGING_RECONNECT_INITIAL_BACKOFF | 1s | 100ms | messaging.reconnectMaxBackoff | duration | Initial NATS reconnect backoff (REQ-MSG-100) |
| messaging.reconnectMaxBackoff | AGENT_MESSAGING_RECONNECT_MAX_BACKOFF | 30s | messaging.reconnectInitialBackoff | 5m | duration | Maximum NATS reconnect backoff (REQ-MSG-100) |

- **Given** the agent is configured with `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME="agent-prod-1"`
- **And** the control plane has created stream `dcm-agent-requests` binding `dcm.agent.>`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** it MUST NOT create a stream on `dcm.agent.agent-prod-1` or `dcm.agents.responses`
- **And** it MUST create durable consumers on `dcm-agent-requests` filtered to `dcm.agent.agent-prod-1` and `dcm.agent.agent-prod-1.cancel`

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-011
- **Given** the agent is configured with a base name containing a dot (e.g. `AGENT_TOPIC_NAME="agent-prod.1"`),
  OR a base name longer than 239 characters (so that appending the `-cancel-consumer` suffix would
  exceed NATS's 255-character JetStream name limit)
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST fail startup immediately with a clear validation error
- **And** it MUST NOT attempt to create the derived JetStream stream/consumer names, which would
  otherwise retry indefinitely per REQ-MSG-051 without ever succeeding

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-090
- **Given** the cancel topic has pending cancel messages and the main topic has creation requests
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** cancel messages MUST be processed first (populating the deny list)
- **And** main topic messages MUST be processed after the deny list is populated
- **And** a transient error from an individual drain `Fetch` call MUST NOT abort the drain early —
  the drain MUST continue retrying until either it observes zero pending messages or the
  configured drain timeout (5s) elapses, whichever comes first

##### AC-MSG-050: Messaging system failure handling

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-100, REQ-MSG-110

##### AC-MSG-052: NATS reconnect uses exponential backoff with jitter

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-100
- **Given** the NATS connection is lost after a successful initial connection
- **When** the client computes successive reconnect delays
- **Then** each delay MUST follow `min(initialInterval × 2^attempt, maxInterval)` with full jitter
  (uniform random in `[0, calculated]`) — the same formula as REQ-DCM-050 — rather than a fixed
  interval
- **And** `initialInterval`/`maxInterval` MUST be configurable (`AGENT_MESSAGING_RECONNECT_INITIAL_BACKOFF`,
  `AGENT_MESSAGING_RECONNECT_MAX_BACKOFF`)

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-135, REQ-XC-CE-050
- **Given** the agent publishes an agent-originated CloudEvent (response or health) via `PublishWithMsgID`
- **When** a raw NATS/JetStream consumer inspects the message as it appears on the wire
- **Then** the message MUST carry a `Nats-Msg-Id` header equal to the CloudEvent's own `id`
- **And** a second publish reusing the same `Nats-Msg-Id` within the stream's duplicate window MUST be
  dropped by JetStream's server-side dedup (observable as no increase in the stream's message count)

##### AC-MSG-012: Request-stream consumer creation retries when CP stream absent

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-051
- **Given** the agent starts before the control plane has created `dcm-agent-requests`
- **When** the agent attempts to create its main durable consumer
- **Then** it MUST retry every 2s with WARN logs for up to 30s (phase 1)
- **And**, if the stream still doesn't exist after 30s, it MUST keep retrying the full setup every 30s in the background indefinitely (phase 2), rather than giving up
- **And** once the stream appears (in either phase) it MUST successfully create the consumer and begin consuming, with no further manual intervention required

##### AC-MSG-015: Durable consumer creation on first start

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-045, REQ-MSG-047
- **Given** the agent starts for the first time (no existing consumers)
- **When** the messaging system connection is established

##### AC-MSG-025: Only prefixed main subject advertised to DCM

- **Validates:** REQ-MSG-050
- **Given** the agent registers to DCM with base name `agent-prod-1`
- **When** the registration payload is sent

### 4.8 Resource Operation Routing

#### Overview

The agent consumes resource operation requests (creation, deletion) from the
messaging system, validates the requested service type, checks SP health, and
routes the request to the appropriate SP. For embedded SPs, routing is an
in-process call. For external SPs, routing is a REST call to the SP's endpoint.

Out of scope: Update/day-2 operations, multi-SP selection strategies.

#### Requirements — Request Validation

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-010 | The agent MUST validate that the requested service type in a creation/deletion CloudEvent is supported by a registered SP | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-020 | If the service type is not supported, the agent MUST publish an error CloudEvent (`dcm.agent.error`) to `dcm.agents.responses` | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Embedded Network Create Compatibility

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-220 | For an embedded Network create request, the agent MUST treat an exact empty-string `routing_level` as omitted before validation for both plain and `{spec: ...}` payloads. Non-empty values MUST continue to be validated against the existing Network schema enum; this compatibility behavior MUST NOT change that enum contract | MUST | Applies only to embedded Network create requests |

#### Requirements — Provider Resolution

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-025 | When resolving the SP for a service type, the agent MUST determine health/readiness state by the provider's ID, not its name | MUST | See DD-180 |
| REQ-RTE-026 | If the resolved provider record has an empty ID (store/registry data corruption), the agent MUST treat it as Unavailable and log the anomaly, instead of querying health state with an empty key or routing to it | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Request Routing (SP Ready)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-030 | When the SP for the requested service type is Ready and embedded, the agent MUST forward the request via an in-process call | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-040 | When the SP for the requested service type is Ready and external, the agent MUST forward creation requests via `POST {endpoint}?id={resource_id}` where `{endpoint}` is the URL provided during SP registration and `{resource_id}` is the inbound CloudEvent's `data.resource_id`, with a JSON body `{"spec": S}` where `S` is the original JSON value from the inbound CloudEvent's `data.spec` | MUST | Apply the same envelope generically to every external SP; preserve `S` as opaque JSON without provider-specific decoding or transformation. The `id` query parameter is the AEP-133 client-assigned resource identifier and MUST match the value later used in `DELETE {endpoint}/{resource_id}` (REQ-RTE-050) |
| REQ-RTE-050 | When the SP for the requested service type is Ready and external, the agent MUST forward deletion requests via `DELETE {endpoint}/{resource_id}` | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-060 | On successful SP response (creation accepted), the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, status: "PROVISIONING"}` | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-070 | On successful SP response (deletion accepted), the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, status: "DELETING"}` | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-080 | On SP error response, the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, error, details}`. `details` MUST be an object with `message` containing the concise service-type summary and optional nested `provider_error: {status_code, message}` containing the SP response status and diagnostic message when an SP response is available. Transport failures MUST NOT expose endpoint URLs in `details.message` or `details.provider_error` | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Request Routing (SP Unhealthy)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-090 | When the SP for the requested service type is Unhealthy, the agent MUST publish the original request CloudEvent to the retry subject (`{base}.retry`) | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-100 | When a request is held in the retry topic, the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.request-queued` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, service_type, status: "QUEUED"}` | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Request Routing (SP Unavailable)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-105 | When the SP for the requested service type is Unavailable, the agent MUST immediately reject the request by publishing a `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` indicating the SP is unavailable | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Retry Policy

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-110 | When the agent forwards a request to an SP and receives a retryable error (5XX status codes, HTTP 429 Too Many Requests, connection failures, or timeouts), the agent MUST apply a configurable retry policy | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-111 | When the agent forwards a request to an SP and receives a non-retryable error (4XX status codes other than 429), the agent MUST report it immediately as an error CloudEvent without retry | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-120 | When retries are exhausted, the agent MUST publish an error CloudEvent with the resource ID | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-130 | The retry policy (max attempts via `routing.retryMaxAttempts`, backoff using formula: min(`routing.retryBackoff` × 2^attempt, `routing.retryMaxBackoff`) with full jitter) MUST be configurable | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-131 | The retry policy in REQ-RTE-110/130 applies to immediate in-line retries for transient SP errors. This is distinct from the retry topic mechanism (Topic 9), which holds requests when an SP's health state is Unhealthy. If all immediate retries are exhausted, the agent MUST publish an error CloudEvent (REQ-RTE-120); the request MUST NOT fall back to the retry topic | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-135 | If the inbound message-handler context is cancelled or its deadline is exceeded while forwarding to the SP or during retry backoff, the agent MUST abort the forward attempt and MUST NOT publish an error CloudEvent | MUST | The caller (e.g. the handler-deadline enforcement of REQ-RCM-190, or consumer shutdown) owns the outcome once it stops waiting; publishing here would be a spurious response to an already-abandoned request |

#### Requirements — Deny List (Cancel Filtering)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-140 | The agent MUST maintain an in-memory deny list of `resource_id` values from consumed cancel CloudEvents | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-150 | When processing creation requests from the main topic, the agent MUST check each `resource_id` against the deny list | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-160 | If a `resource_id` matches the deny list, the agent MUST drop the creation request without forwarding it to the SP | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-170 | If a cancel CloudEvent arrives for a `resource_id` that is already queued in the retry topic, the agent MUST immediately consume the retry topic, remove and acknowledge the matching message, Nak any non-matching messages in place so they remain queued for redelivery, and publish a `dcm.agent.cancel-acknowledged` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses`. The cancelled resource ID MUST also be added to the deny list | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-171 | If a cancel CloudEvent arrives before the retry-topic consumer is available (e.g. during the agent's startup window), the agent MUST still add the `resource_id` to the deny list and publish the `dcm.agent.cancel-acknowledged` CloudEvent, skipping only the retry-topic purge step (there is nothing queued yet) | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-180 | If a cancel CloudEvent arrives for a `resource_id` that has already been dispatched to the SP (request in-flight or SP response received), the agent MUST reject the cancellation by publishing a `dcm.agent.cancel-rejected` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, reason}`. The rejected cancel MUST NOT be added to the deny list | MUST | |
| REQ-RTE-190 | Deny list entries MUST be removed once consumed (used to filter a creation request from the main topic). If the deny list exceeds a configurable maximum size, the oldest entries MUST be evicted (LRU). On restart, the deny list is rebuilt from the cancel topic | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Dispatch Tracking & Concurrency Safety

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RTE-200 | The agent MUST track resources successfully dispatched to an SP (create or delete) in a claimed-resources ledger, used exclusively to reject cancels per REQ-RTE-180. This ledger MUST NOT block a legitimate subsequent forward for the same `resource_id` — e.g. a delete after a successful create, or a retry/redelivery after a prior forward attempt failed. SP-side idempotency (REQ-RCM-210/220) is the safeguard against duplicate side effects, not this ledger | MUST | See DD-190 |
| REQ-RTE-210 | To prevent two concurrent forward attempts for the same `resource_id` from racing into the SP simultaneously (e.g. a JetStream redelivery racing the still in-flight first attempt, or the main-topic and retry-topic paths racing each other), the agent MUST serialize forward attempts per `resource_id` using a transient in-flight lock. The lock MUST be held only for the duration of a single forward attempt and released unconditionally when it completes, regardless of outcome. The lock MUST NOT use size-bounded eviction: an evicted-but-still-held entry would silently permit the exact double-dispatch this requirement exists to prevent. A rejected concurrent attempt MUST be treated as a transient condition (retry shortly), never a permanent block | MUST | DD-190's amendment; this lock is separate from and does not replace the claimed-resources ledger in REQ-RTE-200. Naturally bounded by concurrent-forward count, not resource cardinality, so unbounded is safe |

- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_RETRY_MAX=5` and `AGENT_ROUTING_RETRY_BACKOFF=1s`
- **When** an SP returns a retryable error
- **Then** the agent MUST retry up to 5 times with backoff starting at 1s
- **And** if all retries fail, MUST publish an error CE (not fall back to retry topic)

##### AC-RTE-025: Provider health resolved by ID, not name

- **Validates:** REQ-RTE-025

- **And** the health tracker has state Ready for `"id-not-a-name-12345"` (and no state recorded for `Name`)
- **When** the agent consumes a creation request for that provider's service type
- **Then** the agent MUST forward the request to the SP and publish a `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` CloudEvent (proving health was resolved by `ID`, not `Name` — a `Name`-keyed lookup would find no state and treat the SP as Unavailable)

##### AC-RTE-026: Empty provider ID treated as Unavailable

- **Validates:** REQ-RTE-026
- **Given** a registered provider whose store record has an empty `ID` (data corruption)
- **When** the agent resolves the provider for a creation request

- **And** MUST log the anomaly
- **And** MUST NOT call the SP

##### AC-RTE-135: Context cancellation/deadline suppresses error CE

- **Validates:** REQ-RTE-135
- **Given** an SP call is in progress and the caller's context is cancelled
- **When** the cancellation is observed
- **Then** `HandleRequest` MUST return the context error
- **And** no `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent MUST be published

##### AC-RTE-085: Cancel succeeds before retry-topic consumer is wired

- **Validates:** REQ-RTE-171
- **Given** the retry-topic consumer has not yet been wired into the router (startup window)
- **And** a cancel CloudEvent arrives for a `resource_id` never previously seen
- **When** the cancel is processed
- **Then** the `resource_id` MUST be added to the deny list

- **And** the SP MUST NOT receive a second concurrent call for that `resource_id`
- **Given** the first attempt then completes (successfully or not)
- **When** a later, non-concurrent request for the same `resource_id` arrives (e.g. a legitimate redelivery or a delete-after-create)
- **Then** it MUST NOT be blocked by the in-flight lock

##### AC-RTE-220: Empty routing_level is omitted for embedded Network creation

- **Validates:** REQ-RTE-220
- **Given** a Ready embedded Network provider
- **When** a create request contains a plain or `{spec: ...}` Network spec with `routing_level: ""`
- **Then** the exact empty value MUST be treated as omitted before validation, and the Network lifecycle MUST receive `routing_level` as nil
- **And** when `node_ports` is absent or empty, existing store inference MUST yield `ClusterIP`; when `node_ports` is non-empty, it MUST yield `NodePort`
- **And** an unsupported non-empty `routing_level` MUST still be rejected by the existing schema enum validation before reaching the lifecycle
- **And** the existing Network schema enum MUST remain unchanged

#### Dependencies

### 4.9 Retry & Cancel Mechanisms

#### Overview

The retry subject (`{base}.retry`) holds requests when SPs are unhealthy.
Consumption is event-driven (triggered by SP health state transitions to Ready or
Unavailable, or by agent restart — not periodic). The cancel subject
(`dcm.agent.{base}.cancel`) provides a mechanism for DCM to signal that a request
has been re-routed.

The `retry.Processor` handles retry-subject reprocessing (`ProcessOnTransition`
and `ProcessOnRestart`). Unlike the main and cancel subjects, the retry-subject
consumer does not set `MaxDeliver` (REQ-RCM-150) — see DD-410 for why. Main-subject
consumption, cancel-subject consumption, main-path `MaxDeliver`-exceeded
termination, and main-path handler timeouts are owned by `messaging.Client`
(see REQ-MSG-115, REQ-RCM-160, REQ-RCM-180).

Out of scope: Message TTL/expiry (handled by messaging system configuration).
`MaxDeliver` (REQ-RCM-150) is a distinct mechanism from the out-of-scope
TTL/expiry item above: it bounds the number of delivery *attempts* for a
message, not elapsed time.

#### Requirements — Retry Topic

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-010 | The retry topic MUST hold original CloudEvent bytes published without wrapping, transformation, or additional envelope | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-020 | Consumption of the retry topic MUST be event-driven — triggered by SP health state transitions (Ready per REQ-RCM-030, Unavailable per REQ-RCM-040) or agent restart (per REQ-RCM-080), not by periodic timers. The health check interval (REQ-HMN-030) serves as the natural rate-limiter for retry topic processing | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-030 | When an SP transitions to Ready, the agent MUST consume the retry topic and process requests whose service type has a Ready SP | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-040 | When an SP transitions to Unavailable, the agent MUST consume the retry topic and reject requests whose service type's SP is Unavailable with error CloudEvents to DCM | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-050 | Messages for service types whose SP is still Unhealthy MUST remain queued on the retry topic without triggering additional `dcm.agent.request-queued` CloudEvents (the initial CloudEvent is sent only on first routing per REQ-RTE-100) | MUST | Retry-topic-native messages are Nak'd in place (redelivered without moving streams); a message seen for the first time while still on the main topic (e.g. drained on restart per REQ-RCM-080) is published to the retry topic |
| REQ-RCM-060 | Requests MUST be processed in arrival order per service type. Requests for different service types are independent | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-070 | The retry topic MUST use the same durable consumer pattern as other topics (per REQ-MSG-080), ensuring messages survive agent crashes | MUST | See REQ-MSG-080 |
| REQ-RCM-080 | On restart, the agent MUST re-read both the main topic and the retry topic, and messages that remain queued (SP still Unhealthy) MUST stay queued per REQ-RCM-050 without triggering additional `request-queued` CloudEvents | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Creation/Deletion Dedup

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-090 | If both a creation request and a deletion request for the same resource ID are present in the retry topic, both messages MUST be removed (they cancel out) | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-100 | The agent MUST log the cancellation when dedup occurs | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-110 | The agent MUST acknowledge the deletion to DCM when dedup occurs. The creation request is silently dropped since it was never started | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Cancel Topic

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-120 | See REQ-MSG-070. The cancel topic MUST have an active JetStream consumer subscription | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-130 | See REQ-MSG-090. The cancel topic MUST be drained on startup (until no pending messages or drain timeout elapses) before main/retry processing | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-140 | Cancel CloudEvents MUST contain `resource_id` and `service_type` in their data payload | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Delivery Safety Net (Poison Messages)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-150 | The JetStream consumer for the main subject MUST configure a `MaxDeliver` limit, bounding the number of delivery attempts for a message before it is treated as a poison message. The cancel consumer and the retry-subject consumer MUST NOT set `MaxDeliver` — cancels must not be dropped by delivery-count exhaustion, and retry-subject residency is bounded by SP health-state transitions (REQ-HMN-150), not by delivery count; see DD-410 | MUST | `MaxDeliver` counts delivery attempts, not elapsed time — distinct from the out-of-scope TTL/expiry mechanism |
| REQ-RCM-160 | When a main-subject message's delivery attempts reach the configured `MaxDeliver` without the routing outcome being finalized (per REQ-MSG-115), the messaging client MUST publish a `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent to `dcm.agents.responses` with `error: "MAX_DELIVERY_EXCEEDED"`, then terminate the message so it is not redelivered again | MUST | Enforced in `messaging.Client.handleMainMessage` before router invocation |
| REQ-RCM-170 | The main-subject `MaxDeliver` limit MUST be configurable | MUST | |

#### Requirements — Handler Processing Deadline

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-180 | The agent MUST bound the processing time of each consumed message with a configurable per-message handler deadline, covering forwarding to the SP and awaiting its response. For main-subject messages, enforcement MUST occur in the messaging client before invoking the router; for retry-subject messages, enforcement MUST occur in the retry processor; for cancel-subject messages, enforcement MUST occur in the messaging client before invoking the router's cancel handler, using a separately configurable deadline (REQ-RCM-200) | MUST | Prevents a hung SP call — or, for cancel-subject messages, a hung retry-topic purge/publish — from blocking the consumer indefinitely |
| REQ-RCM-190 | If the handler deadline elapses before the routing outcome is finalized, the agent MUST cancel the in-flight SP call, treat the outcome as a retryable error (per REQ-RTE-110), and MUST NOT acknowledge the message | MUST | Main path: messaging client Naks; retry path: retry processor Naks in place (see `RetryMessage.NakFunc`) |
| REQ-RCM-200 | The handler deadline MUST be configurable. The cancel-subject deadline is a separate config value from the main/retry-subject deadline, since cancel processing is bounded by `CancelAckWait` rather than `AckWait` (see Configuration table) | MUST | |

#### Requirements — SP-Side Idempotency (Event ID Forwarding)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-210 | When forwarding a creation or deletion request to an external SP (per REQ-RTE-040, REQ-RTE-050), the agent MUST set an `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header on the request equal to the inbound CloudEvent's `id` attribute | MUST | Enables SP-side event-level dedup; per DD-190, SPs remain responsible for enforcing idempotency — the agent's obligation is limited to forwarding the key |
| REQ-RCM-220 | The `Idempotency-Key` value forwarded for a given inbound CloudEvent MUST be identical across every delivery attempt of that event — in-line retries (REQ-RTE-110), retry-topic reprocessing (REQ-RCM-030), and JetStream redelivery (REQ-MSG-116) | MUST | Without a stable key, an SP cannot distinguish "same event, retried" from "new event", defeating the purpose of event-level dedup |
| REQ-RCM-230 | For embedded SPs, the agent MUST make the inbound CloudEvent's `id` available to the in-process call (e.g., via request context or a typed request field) | MUST | Keeps idempotency semantics consistent between embedded and external SPs; embedded SPs are not exempt from REQ-RCM-220. Deferred alongside DD-250 — no embedded SP is wired in production, so this is exercised only via a test fake, not a live path |

#### Requirements — Logging

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-RCM-240 | Every CloudEvent publish attempt, success or failure, MUST be logged with `ce_type` and `resource_id` | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-250 | Every SP dispatch (create or delete, embedded or external) MUST be logged at INFO on completion with `resource_id`, `service_type`, provider kind (embedded/external), `operation`, and `duration`; failed external dispatches MUST additionally include `http_status`. Request/response bodies MUST NOT be logged | MUST | |
| REQ-RCM-260 | Deny-list drops (create requests for a cancelled resource) and cancel-topic purge actions MUST be logged at INFO with `resource_id` and, for purge, matched/requeued counts | MUST | Purge Naks non-matching messages in place rather than republishing them — see REQ-RTE-170 |

#### Configuration — Topic 9

| Config Key | Env Var | Default | Min | Max | Unit | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| messaging.maxDeliver | AGENT_MESSAGING_MAX_DELIVER | 10 | 1 | 100 | integer | Maximum JetStream delivery attempts for a **main-subject** message before terminal error CE and termination (REQ-RCM-150). Does not apply to the retry-subject or cancel consumers — see DD-410 |
| routing.handlerTimeout | AGENT_ROUTING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT | 60s | 1s | 10m | duration | Maximum time allowed to process a single consumed message, including the SP call (REQ-RCM-180) |
| routing.cancelHandlerTimeout | AGENT_ROUTING_CANCEL_HANDLER_TIMEOUT | 5s | 500ms | 1m | duration | Maximum time allowed to process a single cancel-subject message, including the retry-topic purge and response CE publish (REQ-RCM-180). MUST be less than `messaging.cancelAckWait` |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-RCM-010: SP recovers — retry topic processed

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-020, REQ-RCM-030, REQ-RCM-010
- **Given** the retry topic contains 3 requests for service type "database"
- **And** the SP for "database" transitions from Unhealthy to Ready
- **When** the health state change is detected
- **Then** the agent MUST consume the retry topic
- **And** MUST forward the 3 requests to the SP
- **And** the original CE bytes MUST be published without wrapping

##### AC-RCM-020: SP becomes Unavailable — retry topic drained

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-040, REQ-HMN-150
- **Given** the retry topic contains 2 requests for service type "database"
- **And** the SP for "database" transitions to Unavailable
- **When** the health state change is detected
- **Then** the agent MUST reject both requests with error CloudEvents to DCM

##### AC-RCM-030: Mixed service types in retry topic

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-050
- **Given** the retry topic contains requests for "database" (Unhealthy) and "container" (Unavailable)
- **When** the agent processes the retry topic
- **Then** "container" requests MUST be rejected (Unavailable)
- **And** "database" requests MUST remain queued in the retry topic (still Unhealthy)
- **And** remaining queued MUST NOT trigger additional `dcm.agent.request-queued` CloudEvents

##### AC-RCM-040: FIFO ordering per service type

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-060
- **Given** the retry topic contains requests A, B, C for service type "database" in that order
- **When** the SP recovers to Ready
- **Then** requests MUST be forwarded to the SP in order: A, then B, then C

##### AC-RCM-050: Creation-deletion dedup

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-090, REQ-RCM-100, REQ-RCM-110
- **Given** the retry topic contains a creation request for `resource_id="res-123"` and a deletion request for `resource_id="res-123"`
- **When** the retry topic is processed
- **Then** both messages MUST be removed
- **And** the deletion acknowledgment MUST be published as a `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged` CloudEvent with `status: "DELETED"`
- **And** the cancellation MUST be logged

##### AC-RCM-060: Cancel topic drained at startup

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-130, REQ-RTE-190, REQ-RCM-140
- **Given** the cancel topic has messages for `resource_id="res-456"` and `resource_id="res-789"`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the deny list MUST contain both resource IDs before main topic processing begins
- **And** each cancel CE MUST contain `resource_id` and `service_type`

##### AC-RCM-045: Restart re-reads topics without extra CEs

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-080
- **Given** the retry topic contains messages from a prior session
- **When** the agent restarts and re-reads the retry topic
- **Then** messages for still-Unhealthy SPs MUST remain queued without triggering additional `request-queued` CloudEvents

##### AC-RCM-047: Restart-drain is not skipped when messaging isn't immediately ready

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-080, REQ-MSG-100
- **Given** the messaging system is unreachable at the instant the agent calls
  `messaging.Client.Start` (per AC-MSG-050 — `Start` is non-blocking and returns
  before NATS/JetStream is confirmed ready)
- **When** NATS/JetStream subsequently becomes reachable, whether moments later or
  after a longer outage
- **Then** the agent MUST still perform the restart-drain of the main/retry/cancel
  durable consumers (per REQ-RCM-080) before beginning live main/cancel consumption
- **And** this MUST NOT depend on the restart-drain call happening to run only once,
  synchronously, immediately after `Start` returns — restart-drain has no retry of
  its own, so triggering it too early (before JetStream is ready) must not silently
  skip it permanently

##### AC-RCM-070: MaxDeliver exceeded — terminal error CE and termination

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-150, REQ-RCM-160
- **Given** `AGENT_MESSAGING_MAX_DELIVER=5` and a creation request for `resource_id="res-999"` that repeatedly fails to reach a finalized routing outcome (e.g. the handler crashes before acking)
- **When** the message has been delivered 5 times without acknowledgment
- **Then** the agent MUST publish a `dcm.agent.error` CloudEvent for `resource_id="res-999"` with `error: "MAX_DELIVERY_EXCEEDED"`
- **And** the message MUST be acknowledged/terminated so a 6th delivery does not occur

##### AC-RCM-080: MaxDeliver is configurable

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-170
- **Given** `AGENT_MESSAGING_MAX_DELIVER=10`
- **When** the agent creates the main-subject durable consumer at startup
- **Then** the main consumer MUST be configured with a maximum of 10 delivery attempts
- **And** the retry-subject consumer MUST be configured with no `MaxDeliver` limit (see DD-410)

##### AC-RCM-090: Handler deadline aborts a hung SP call

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-180, REQ-RCM-190
- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT=30s`
- **And** an external SP accepts the connection but never responds to a forwarded creation request
- **When** 30s elapses without a response
- **Then** the agent MUST cancel the in-flight call
- **And** MUST treat the outcome as a retryable error per REQ-RTE-110
- **And** MUST NOT acknowledge the message

##### AC-RCM-100: Handler deadline is configurable

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-200
- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_HANDLER_TIMEOUT=45s`
- **When** the agent begins processing a message consumed from the main topic
- **Then** the context passed to the SP call MUST carry a deadline no later than 45s from consumption

##### AC-RCM-105: Cancel handler deadline aborts a hung cancel-topic purge

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-180, REQ-RCM-190, REQ-RCM-200
- **Given** `AGENT_ROUTING_CANCEL_HANDLER_TIMEOUT` is set
- **And** the cancel handler's downstream work (retry-topic purge or response CE publish) hangs
- **When** the configured timeout elapses without the cancel handler returning
- **Then** the context passed to the cancel handler MUST be cancelled
- **And** the message MUST be Nak'd (not acknowledged), eligible for redelivery

##### AC-RCM-110: Idempotency-Key forwarded to external SP

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-210
- **Given** an inbound `dcm.request.create` CloudEvent with `id="evt-abc-123"` and `resource_id="res-1"`
- **When** the agent forwards the request via `POST {endpoint}?id={resource_id}` (REQ-RTE-040)
- **Then** the HTTP request MUST include the header `Idempotency-Key: evt-abc-123`

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-220
- **Given** an inbound CloudEvent with `id="evt-abc-123"` initially triggers a retryable SP error
- **When** the agent retries the forward in-line per REQ-RTE-110, and separately when the same message is later redelivered by JetStream or reprocessed from the retry topic
- **Then** every attempt MUST forward the same `Idempotency-Key: evt-abc-123` header

##### AC-RCM-130: Idempotency-Key available to embedded SPs

- **Validates:** REQ-RCM-230
- **Given** an embedded SP is registered and Ready for service type "container"
- **And** an inbound CloudEvent with `id="evt-xyz-789"` requests creation of a "container" resource
- **When** the agent forwards the request via in-process call
- **Then** the embedded SP call MUST receive `"evt-xyz-789"` as the CE id
- **Note:** Deferred alongside DD-250 — exercised only via a test fake (`routingtest.RegisterEmbeddedSP`), since no embedded SP is wired in production

##### AC-RCM-140: CloudEvent publish outcome logged

- **Given** a create request is dropped because its `resource_id` is on the deny list
- **When** it is dropped
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `resource_id`
- **Given** `purgeFromRetryTopic` completes
- **When** it returns
- **Then** an INFO log MUST be emitted with `resource_id`, `matched`, `requeued`

#### Dependencies

Depends on Topic 5 (SP Health Monitoring), Topic 7 (Messaging System
Integration), and Topic 8 (Resource Operation Routing).

### 4.10 Container Status Monitoring (Stuck-Rollout Detection)

#### Overview

The embedded container SP's status-monitoring subsystem
(`internal/openshift/container/monitoring`) derives a `container` resource's DCM status from
the live state of its Kubernetes Deployment and Pod. This stub covers only the stuck-initial-
rollout detection added for FLPATH-4851: a Deployment whose rollout never progresses (bad/
missing image, unschedulable Pod, bad container config) past `spec.progressDeadlineSeconds`
(API-server default: 600s). Scope is deliberately limited to the initial rollout — a container
that starts fine and only later crash-loops (`CrashLoopBackOff` after a prior successful
`Running`/`Available` state) is out of scope (see D1 in
`.ai/exploration/FLPATH-4851-assessment.md`). This is a minimal stub, not a full Topic; the
broader container/storage Kubernetes status-monitoring subsystem has no other tracked REQ/AC/DD
coverage yet — that remains a separate, larger follow-up.

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-CNT-500 | `ReconcileStatus` MUST check the Deployment's `Progressing`/`ProgressDeadlineExceeded` condition before, and with precedence over, pod-phase mapping, and MUST evaluate it unconditionally of whether a Pod exists | MUST | See DD-500 |

##### AC-CNT-500: FAILED reported on stuck rollout regardless of Pod existence/phase

- **Validates:** REQ-CNT-500
- **Given** a Deployment whose rollout has exceeded `progressDeadlineSeconds` (`Status.Conditions` contains `Type: Progressing, Status: False, Reason: ProgressDeadlineExceeded`)
- **When** `ReconcileStatus` is called, whether or not a Pod exists and regardless of the Pod's phase
- **Then** the resource MUST be reported `FAILED`

##### AC-CNT-501: No latching — live state on recovery

- **Validates:** REQ-CNT-500
- **Given** a resource previously reported `FAILED` per AC-CNT-500
- **When** the Deployment's rollout subsequently recovers (`Progressing` flips back to `True`)
- **Then** the next reconcile MUST report the corresponding live status (e.g. `PENDING`/`RUNNING`), not remain latched at `FAILED` (see DD-500's no-latch divergence from storage)

##### AC-CNT-502: Existing deploy-only Replicas==0/ReplicaFailure checks unaffected

- **Validates:** REQ-CNT-500
- **Given** a Deployment explicitly scaled to zero, or reporting `DeploymentReplicaFailure=True`, with no stuck-rollout condition present
- **When** `ReconcileStatus` is called
- **Then** existing `FAILED`-detection behavior for those cases MUST be unaffected (regression guard)

---

### 4.11 API Authentication

#### Overview

JWT Bearer token authentication for the agent's REST API, validated against
Keycloak via OIDC discovery. The health endpoint is exempt (unauthenticated).
Authentication can be entirely disabled for development and testing.

This is a simplified port of the control-plane's auth package. Key differences:
no actor resolution (no database, no actor model), no proxy-secret path, no
`ActorCache`. JWT claims (`sub`, `preferred_username`) go directly into request
context.

Out of scope: Authorization (RBAC/policy decisions beyond "is the token valid"),
actor provisioning, proxy-secret header authentication, token refresh/issuance.

**Note on token shape:** `OIDCValidator` (backed by `coreos/go-oidc/v3`) validates
*any* signed Bearer JWT issued by the configured OIDC issuer — most commonly a
Keycloak **access** token, not strictly an OpenID Connect ID token. A default
Keycloak client configuration does not attach an `aud` claim to access tokens
unless an audience protocol mapper (e.g. `dcm-api-audience` in control-plane's
Keycloak realm export, which injects `aud: "dcm-api"` on access tokens only) is
configured on the client. Operators who want `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE`
enforcement MUST configure such a mapper on the agent's Keycloak client;
without it, access tokens carry no `aud` claim at all, and validation only
succeeds because of the `SkipClientIDCheck` fallback used when the audience is
left empty (REQ-AUTH-110). This behavior, including both the audience-match
and no-audience-configured paths, is proven independently in this repo (see
AC-AUTH-120 / UT-AUTH-110–112) against a locally-generated RSA keypair, OIDC
discovery document, and JWKS — it does not depend on `control-plane`'s tests.
This repo also has its own real-Keycloak proof, independent of `control-plane`'s:
AC-AUTH-130, exercised by a dedicated `docker-compose`-based subsystem test
(`test/subsystem/auth`, Ginkgo `-tags=subsystem`) that runs the full agent
binary against a real Keycloak container. `control-plane`'s `internal/auth/jwt.go`
uses a structurally near-identical `NewOIDCValidator`/`Validate` implementation
(same `coreos/go-oidc/v3` usage) and predates this repo's own proof — it remains
useful prior art, but is no longer the sole evidence that this pattern holds
against a real IdP.

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-AUTH-010 | The agent MUST validate JWT Bearer tokens on all REST API endpoints (except health, see REQ-AUTH-020) using OIDC discovery against the configured issuer URL to obtain JWKS keys | MUST | Validates signature, expiry, issuer, audience |
| REQ-AUTH-020 | The agent MUST bypass authentication for the health endpoint (`GET /api/v1alpha1/health`) | MUST | Health probes must succeed without credentials |
| REQ-AUTH-030 | The agent MUST support a disabled authentication mode (`AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=true`) that passes all requests through without token validation | MUST | Default for v1alpha1 to avoid breaking existing deployments |
| REQ-AUTH-040 | When authentication is enabled and a request lacks a valid Bearer token, the agent MUST return HTTP 401 with an RFC 9457 error body (`type: https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unauthenticated`) and a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` response header | MUST | Per REQ-XC-ERR-010 |
| REQ-AUTH-050 | After successful JWT validation, the agent MUST extract `sub` and `preferred_username` claims from the token and make them available in the request context for downstream middleware and handlers | MUST | |
| REQ-AUTH-060 | After successful JWT validation, the auth middleware MUST log the authenticated identity at DEBUG level including `sub`, `preferred_username`, HTTP method, and request path | MUST | DEBUG keeps production logs clean; operators enable when needed |
| REQ-AUTH-070 | The request logger middleware (REQ-HTTP-060) MUST include `sub` and `preferred_username` from context in per-request log entries when authentication has populated them | MUST | Every request log line gets an identity tag for audit |
| REQ-AUTH-080 | Auth middleware MUST execute after panic recovery (REQ-HTTP-071) and before the request logger (REQ-HTTP-060) in the middleware chain | MUST | Rejects unauthenticated requests before body parsing; panics in auth are caught |
| REQ-AUTH-090 | When authentication is disabled, the agent MUST log a warning at startup | MUST | |
| REQ-AUTH-100 | The agent MUST fail fast on startup when authentication is enabled (`AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=false`) and `AGENT_AUTH_ISSUER_URL` is empty | MUST | |
| REQ-AUTH-110 | When `AGENT_AUTH_ISSUER_URL` is set but `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` is empty, the agent SHOULD log a warning | SHOULD | Audience validation is strongly recommended |
| REQ-AUTH-120 | When the auth middleware rejects a request due to a missing, malformed, or invalid Bearer token, the agent MUST emit exactly one per-request INFO log entry equivalent to the request logger's (REQ-HTTP-060), including `method`, `path`, `status` (401), and `duration` | MUST | Auth executes before the request logger (REQ-AUTH-080), so rejected requests never reach it; this keeps the audit trail complete without reordering the chain |

#### Configuration Introduced

| Config Key | Env Var | Default | Min | Max | Unit | Description |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| auth.disabled | AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED | true | - | - | bool | Disable JWT authentication entirely |
| auth.issuerUrl | AGENT_AUTH_ISSUER_URL | - | - | - | URL | Keycloak OIDC issuer URL (required when auth enabled) |
| auth.audience | AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE | - | - | - | string | Expected JWT audience claim |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-AUTH-010: Valid JWT token accepted

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-010, REQ-AUTH-050
- **Given** authentication is enabled with a valid OIDC issuer URL
- **When** a request includes a valid Bearer token with `sub` and `preferred_username` claims
- **Then** the request MUST proceed to the handler
- **And** JWT claims MUST be available in the request context

##### AC-AUTH-020: Health endpoint bypasses authentication

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-020
- **Given** authentication is enabled
- **When** a `GET` request targets `/api/v1alpha1/health`
- **Then** the request MUST proceed without requiring a Bearer token

##### AC-AUTH-030: Missing Bearer token rejected

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-040
- **Given** authentication is enabled
- **When** a request arrives without an `Authorization` header
- **Then** the agent MUST respond with HTTP 401
- **And** the response body MUST be RFC 9457 JSON with `type: https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unauthenticated`
- **And** the response MUST include a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header

##### AC-AUTH-040: Invalid Bearer token rejected

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-040
- **Given** authentication is enabled
- **When** a request includes an expired, malformed, or incorrectly-signed Bearer token
- **Then** the agent MUST respond with HTTP 401
- **And** the response body MUST be RFC 9457 JSON with `type: https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unauthenticated`

##### AC-AUTH-050: Disabled auth mode passes all requests

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-030
- **Given** `AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=true`
- **When** any request arrives (with or without a Bearer token)
- **Then** the request MUST proceed without authentication checks

##### AC-AUTH-060: Config validation — issuer required when enabled

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-100
- **Given** `AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=false` and `AGENT_AUTH_ISSUER_URL` is empty
- **When** configuration is validated at startup
- **Then** the agent MUST fail fast with an error identifying the missing issuer URL

##### AC-AUTH-070: Authenticated identity in request log

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-070
- **Given** authentication is enabled and a request includes a valid Bearer token
- **When** the request logger emits its per-request INFO log line
- **Then** the log MUST include `sub` from JWT claims
- **And** MUST include `preferred_username` when present in the token

##### AC-AUTH-080: Authenticated identity logged at DEBUG

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-060
- **Note:** despite the matching number, this AC does not validate REQ-AUTH-080 —
  REQ-AUTH-080 covers middleware ordering and is validated by AC-AUTH-090 instead.
- **Given** authentication is enabled and a request includes a valid Bearer token
- **When** the auth middleware validates the token
- **Then** a DEBUG-level log MUST be emitted with `sub`, `preferred_username`, `method`, and `path`

##### AC-AUTH-090: Middleware ordering

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-080
- **Given** the middleware chain is configured
- **Then** the auth middleware MUST execute after `PanicRecovery` and before `RequestLogger`
- **And** auth MUST execute before the OpenAPI request validator

##### AC-AUTH-100: Startup warning when auth disabled

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-090
- **Given** `AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=true`
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** a WARN-level log MUST be emitted indicating authentication is disabled

##### AC-AUTH-110: Authentication rejection produces request audit log

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-120
- **Given** authentication is enabled
- **When** a request is rejected with HTTP 401 due to a missing, malformed, or invalid Bearer token
- **Then** exactly one INFO-level log entry equivalent to the request logger's MUST be emitted, including `method`, `path`, `status: 401`, and `duration`
- **And** the middleware ordering from AC-AUTH-090 (auth before `RequestLogger`) MUST be unchanged
- **And** successful authenticated requests MUST continue to include `sub` and `preferred_username` per AC-AUTH-070

##### AC-AUTH-120: OIDC validator audience enforcement matches real signed tokens

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-010, REQ-AUTH-110
- **Given** a real RS256-signed JWT shaped like a Keycloak access token, obtained via genuine OIDC discovery and JWKS resolution (not a mocked `JWTValidator`)
- **When** the token's `aud` claim matches the configured `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- **Then** `OIDCValidator.Validate` MUST succeed and return the token's `sub`/`preferred_username`
- **And** when the token's `aud` claim does not match the configured audience, `Validate` MUST fail
- **And** when the token carries no `aud` claim at all and `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` is empty (the `SkipClientIDCheck` path), `Validate` MUST still succeed, so authentication fails open on audience rather than silently breaking when no mapper is configured

##### AC-AUTH-130: Full agent process authenticates against a real Keycloak container end-to-end

- **Validates:** REQ-AUTH-010, REQ-AUTH-040
- **Given** the full agent binary is running with `AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=false`, `AGENT_AUTH_ISSUER_URL`
  pointed at a real Keycloak container, and `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` set — not a mocked
  `JWTValidator` (see AC-AUTH-010/030/040) and not the self-signed OIDC harness (see AC-AUTH-120)
- **When** a request to `GET /api/v1alpha1/providers` carries a genuine access token issued by
  that Keycloak instance whose `aud` claim matches `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- **Then** the request MUST succeed
- **And** a request with no `Authorization` header MUST be rejected with HTTP 401
- **And** a request with a tampered (signature-invalidated) token MUST be rejected with HTTP 401
- **And** a request with a validly-signed token from the same issuer whose `aud` claim does not
  match `AGENT_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` MUST be rejected with HTTP 401
- **Note:** proven by a dedicated `docker-compose`-based subsystem test
  (`test/subsystem/auth`, Ginkgo `-tags=subsystem`, run by `.github/workflows/subsystem.yaml`),
  the same real-container pattern control-plane uses for its own auth subsystem proof. See
  `.ai/test-plans/2026-09-22-subsystem-tests.md` (ST-AUTH-010–040).

#### Dependencies

Depends on Topic 1 (HTTP Server) for middleware chain and server lifecycle.
Uses cross-cutting error handling (§5.1) for RFC 9457 responses.

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 Error Handling

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-XC-ERR-010 | All HTTP error responses MUST conform to RFC 9457 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs) using the Error schema defined in the OpenAPI spec | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-ERR-020 | Error responses MUST set `Content-Type: application/problem+json` | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-ERR-030 | Error responses SHOULD include `detail` and `instance` fields. The `instance` field SHOULD be the request URI | SHOULD | |
| REQ-XC-ERR-040 | Error responses for INTERNAL errors MUST NOT include stack traces, file paths, internal error messages, or hostnames | MUST | |

**Error type mapping:**

> Error `type` values are project-controlled URIs under
> `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/`, as RFC 9457 section 3.1.1 requires. Each type
> carries exactly one status and one title; they are derived from the type, never passed per
> call site.

| Error Condition | HTTP Status | Error Type | Title |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Invalid request body | 400 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/invalid-argument` | Invalid argument |
| Unauthenticated request | 401 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unauthenticated` | Unauthenticated |
| Forbidden request | 403 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/permission-denied` | Permission denied |
| Resource not found | 404 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/not-found` | Not found |
| Service type conflict | 409 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/already-exists` | Already exists |
| Validation failure | 422 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unprocessable-entity` | Unprocessable entity |
| Unexpected error | 500 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/internal` | Internal Server Error |
| Service unavailable | 503 | `https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/unavailable` | Service unavailable |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-XC-ERR-010: RFC 9457 compliance

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-ERR-010, REQ-XC-ERR-030
- **Given** any error condition in the API
- **When** an error response is returned
- **Then** the body MUST conform to the RFC 9457 Error schema with at minimum `type` and `title` fields
- **And** SHOULD include `detail` and `instance` (= request URI) fields

##### AC-XC-ERR-020: Error content type

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-ERR-020
- **Given** any error response
- **When** the response is sent
- **Then** the `Content-Type` header MUST be `application/problem+json`

##### AC-XC-ERR-030: No implementation detail leakage

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-ERR-040
- **Given** an internal error occurs
- **When** the error response is returned
- **Then** the `detail` field MUST contain a static, non-revealing message (e.g., `"An unexpected internal error occurred"`)
- **And** the response MUST NOT contain stack traces, file paths, internal error messages, or hostnames

### 5.2 CloudEvent Definitions

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-XC-CE-010 | All messages exchanged through the messaging system MUST use CloudEvents v1.0 specification | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CE-020 | All agent-originated CloudEvents MUST include: `id` (unique), `source`, `type`, `specversion`, and `time` (RFC 3339 timestamp) | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CE-030 | The `source` attribute for agent-originated CloudEvents MUST be `dcm/agents/{agentName}` (see DD-200; not the DCM-assigned agent ID) | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CE-040 | The `specversion` MUST be `"1.0"` | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CE-050 | Agent-originated CloudEvents published to JetStream (responses and health) MUST set the JetStream `Nats-Msg-Id` header to the CloudEvent's own `id` attribute for server-side deduplication | MUST | See REQ-MSG-135 |

**CloudEvent message definitions:**

| Message | `type` | `source` | NATS destination | `data` |
|---------|--------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Creation Request (inbound) | `dcm.request.create` | `dcm/control-plane` | `dcm.agent.{base}` | `{resource_id, service_type, spec}` |
| Deletion Request (inbound) | `dcm.request.delete` | `dcm/control-plane` | `dcm.agent.{base}` | `{resource_id, service_type}` |
| Cancel Request (inbound) | `dcm.request.cancel` | `dcm/control-plane` | `dcm.agent.{base}.cancel` | `{resource_id, service_type}` |
| Creation Acknowledged | `dcm.agent.creation-acknowledged` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, status: "PROVISIONING"}` |
| Deletion Acknowledged | `dcm.agent.deletion-acknowledged` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, status: "DELETING"}`. When dedup occurs (create+delete both in retry topic, per REQ-RCM-110), use `status: "DELETED"` (terminal). Normal SP-accepted deletes use `status: "DELETING"` |
| Cancel Acknowledged | `dcm.agent.cancel-acknowledged` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, service_type}` |
| Cancel Rejected | `dcm.agent.cancel-rejected` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, reason}` |
| Request Queued | `dcm.agent.request-queued` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, service_type, status: "QUEUED"}` |
| Error | `dcm.agent.error` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.responses` | `{resource_id, agent_name, topic_name, error, details: {message, provider_error?}}` |
| Health Degraded | `dcm.agent.health.service-type-degraded` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.health` | `{agent_id, agent_name, topic_name, service_type, reason, affected_provider}` — `agent_id` uses `agent_name` until DCM registration completes (DD-200) |
| Health Unavailable | `dcm.agent.health.service-type-unavailable` | `dcm/agents/{agentName}` | `dcm.agents.health` | `{agent_id, agent_name, topic_name, service_type, reason, affected_provider}` — same `agent_id` convention as Health Degraded |

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CE-030
- **Given** the agent is configured with `AGENT_NAME="agent-prod-1"`
- **When** a CloudEvent is published

### 5.3 Logging

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| REQ-XC-LOG-010 | Structured logging MUST be used in JSON format with required fields: time (RFC 3339), level, msg. Additional fields (caller, error, component) are OPTIONAL | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-LOG-020 | Log levels MUST follow the defined convention: ERROR (unrecoverable failures), WARN (recoverable issues), INFO (lifecycle events), DEBUG (detailed data) | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-LOG-030 | The agent MUST use a single canonical field name for each correlation concept across all log entries: `resource_id`, `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `service_type`, `provider_id`. Log entries MUST NOT use alternate spellings (`resourceId`, `providerID`, `serviceType`, etc.) | MUST | Enables cross-log correlation for auditing a resource's or provider's full lifecycle |

**Log level convention:**

| Level | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| ERROR | Unrecoverable failures, messaging system errors, DCM registration failures (non-retryable) |
| WARN | Recoverable issues, registration retries, SP health transitions, pod condition update failures |
| INFO | Lifecycle events, SP registration/deregistration, health state changes, request routing |
| DEBUG | Detailed request/response data, health check results, CloudEvent payloads |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-XC-LOG-010: Structured logging

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-LOG-010
- **Given** any operation occurs in the agent

- **Given** an unrecoverable failure occurs
- **When** the event is logged
- **Then** it MUST use ERROR level
- **And** recoverable issues MUST use WARN
- **And** lifecycle events MUST use INFO

##### AC-XC-LOG-030: Canonical correlation field names

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-LOG-030
- **Given** any log entry includes a resource, CloudEvent, service-type, or provider correlation field
- **When** the entry is emitted
- **Then** the field key MUST be one of `resource_id`, `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `service_type`, `provider_id`
- **And** it MUST NOT use a camelCase variant of any of these keys

| REQ-XC-CFG-010 | All configuration MUST be loadable from environment variables. Configuration MAY additionally be loaded from a configuration file. When both sources provide a value, environment variables MUST take precedence over file-based configuration | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CFG-020 | The agent MUST fail fast on startup when required configuration values are absent or empty | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CFG-030 | Required configuration values: AGENT_NAME, AGENT_ENVIRONMENT, AGENT_COST, DCM_REGISTRATION_URL, AGENT_MESSAGING_URL | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CFG-040 | AGENT_COST MUST be one of: `low`, `medium-low`, `medium`, `medium-high`, `high` | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CFG-041 | Invalid AGENT_COST values MUST cause the agent to fail fast on startup | MUST | |
| REQ-XC-CFG-050 | Configuration values outside the defined valid ranges MUST cause the agent to fail fast on startup with an error identifying the invalid value and its valid range | MUST | |

#### Acceptance Criteria

##### AC-XC-CFG-010: Environment variable configuration

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-010
- **Given** any configuration value
- **When** the corresponding environment variable is set
- **Then** the agent MUST use the value from the environment variable

##### AC-XC-CFG-011: Configuration file loading

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-010
- **Given** `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE` points at a `.env`-style file (one `KEY=VALUE` pair per line, using
  the same environment variable names as the corresponding config struct tags, e.g.
  `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090`) providing a value
- **And** the corresponding environment variable is not set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST use the value from the configuration file

##### AC-XC-CFG-012: Environment variable takes precedence over file

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-010
- **Given** the config file (referenced by `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE`) provides `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:9090`
- **And** the environment variable `AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=:7070` is also set
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST use `:7070` (environment variable wins)

##### AC-XC-CFG-013: Config file format details

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-010
- **Given** a config file referenced by `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE`
- **Then** blank lines and lines starting with `#` MUST be ignored
- **And** a line without an `=` separator MUST cause the agent to fail fast with an error
  identifying `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE` and the offending line
- **And** a nonexistent or unreadable file referenced by `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE` MUST cause the agent
  to fail fast with an error identifying `AGENT_CONFIG_FILE`
- **And** loading MUST NOT mutate the process's real environment variables (`os.Setenv`) as a side
  effect — merging happens in an isolated map so `Load()` remains safe to call repeatedly

##### AC-XC-CFG-020: Fail-fast on missing required config

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-020, REQ-XC-CFG-030
- **Given** a required config value (AGENT_NAME, AGENT_ENVIRONMENT, AGENT_COST, DCM_REGISTRATION_URL, AGENT_MESSAGING_URL) is absent or empty
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST return an error identifying the missing field
- **And** MUST exit before starting the HTTP server or any subsystem

##### AC-XC-CFG-030: Fail-fast on invalid AGENT_COST

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-040, REQ-XC-CFG-041
- **Given** AGENT_COST is set to an invalid value (e.g., "expensive")
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST return an error identifying the invalid configuration
- **And** MUST exit before starting any subsystem

##### AC-XC-CFG-050: Invalid config range fails fast

- **Validates:** REQ-XC-CFG-050
- **Given** `AGENT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=0ms` (below minimum)
- **When** the agent starts
- **Then** the agent MUST exit with an error identifying the invalid value and its valid range

## 6. Consolidated Configuration Reference

All configuration is loadable from environment variables. Configuration files are also supported; environment variables take precedence.

\* `health.podConditionsEnabled` is parsed and validated but never read past
config loading — pod-condition updates are unimplemented in v1alpha1. See
DD-270.

## 7. Design Decisions

See [Design Decisions](../decisions/environment-agent.decisions.md).

## 8. Assumptions

- NATS with JetStream is deployed and accessible to both DCM and the agent
  (consistent with other DCM components). The control plane pre-provisions
  `dcm-agent-requests` and `dcm-agent-responses` streams; the agent creates
  durable consumers and its own internal retry stream
- The agent has outbound network connectivity to DCM's REST API (for
  registration and heartbeats)
- External SPs have network connectivity to the agent's REST API (for
  registration and health checks)
- The agent has access to local persistent storage for persisting SP
  registrations across restarts
- For Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments: the agent's service account has RBAC
  permissions for the `pods/status` subresource
- SP idempotent creation behavior is the final safety net for duplicate requests
  (see DD-060)
- ASM-RTE-010: Service Providers MUST implement idempotent create and delete
  operations with respect to resource ID (`resource_id`). Duplicate invocations (from JetStream
  redelivery or retry) MUST NOT produce side effects beyond the first successful
  execution.
- NATS JetStream provides durable persistence for streams using file-based
  storage (messages survive consumer and server restarts)
